## Core Components

### 1. Agent System

**Purpose**: Manage autonomous AI agents with role-based personas

**Key Files**: 
- `internal/agenticorp/worker_manager.go`
- `internal/models/agent.go`

**Concepts**:
- **Agent**: An autonomous actor with a defined role and persona
- **Persona**: Instructions, guidelines, and behavioral rules for an agent
- **Status**: `idle`, `working`, `paused`, `complete`
- **Role**: Org chart position (CEO, CFO, Engineer, etc.)

**Workflow**:
1. Agents are created from personas on project assignment
2. Agents remain paused until a provider becomes available
3. When providers are healthy, agents resume and can accept work
4. Agents process beads, make decisions, request escalations

**Database**: `agents` table with status, role, and capability tracking

### 2. Bead System (Work Items)

**Purpose**: Define and track discrete units of work in the system

**Key Files**:
- `internal/models/bead.go`
- `docs/BEADS_WORKFLOW.md`

**Concepts**:
- **Bead**: A YAML-defined work item with type, priority, and dependencies
- **Status**: `open`, `in_progress`, `done`, `blocked`
- **Type**: Describes the work (feature, bugfix, test, decision, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: `blocked_by`, `blocks`, `parent`, `children`

**Workflow**:
1. Beads are YAML files in `.beads/beads/` directories
2. Each bead has a unique ID and metadata
3. Beads are loaded at startup and on project changes
4. Agents process ready beads (no blocking dependencies)
5. Completion updates the work graph in real-time

**Database**: `beads` table with status, priority, and dependency tracking

### 3. Provider System

**Purpose**: Interface with external LLM providers with intelligent routing and cost optimization

**Key Files**:
- `pkg/provider/provider.go`
- `internal/models/provider.go`
- `internal/routing/router.go` (NEW v1.0)
- `internal/agenticorp/agenticorp.go` (provider management)

**Concepts**:
- **Provider**: An external LLM service (local or cloud)
- **Endpoint**: Network address for provider communication
- **Model**: LLM served by the provider (e.g., Nemotron, GPT-4)
- **Status**: `pending`, `active`, `error`
- **Cost Metadata** (NEW v1.0): Cost per million tokens for optimization
- **Capabilities** (NEW v1.0): Context window, function calling, vision support
- **Routing Policy** (NEW v1.0): Selection strategy (cost, latency, quality, balanced)

**Workflow**:
1. Providers are registered via UI with endpoint, model, and cost info
2. Immediate health check validates provider availability
3. Provider heartbeat workflow monitors health (30s interval)
4. On status change, agents resume or pause accordingly
5. **Router selects optimal provider** based on policy and requirements (NEW v1.0)
6. Automatic failover if selected provider fails

**Database**: `providers` table with endpoint, status, cost, capabilities, and heartbeat tracking

### 3.1 Provider Routing System (NEW v1.0)

**Purpose**: Intelligently select providers based on cost, latency, quality, and capabilities

**Key Files**:
- `internal/routing/router.go`
- `internal/routing/router_test.go`
- `internal/api/handlers_routing.go`

**Routing Policies**:
1. **minimize_cost**: Select cheapest provider (30%+ savings)
2. **minimize_latency**: Select fastest provider (<1ms routing)
3. **maximize_quality**: Select provider with best capabilities
4. **balanced** (default): Balance cost (30%), latency (30%), quality (40%)

**Provider Requirements**:
- `MaxCostPerMToken`: Maximum acceptable cost
- `MaxLatencyMs`: Maximum acceptable latency
- `MinContextWindow`: Minimum context window size
- `RequiresFunction`: Must support function calling
- `RequiresVision`: Must support vision/multimodal
- `RequiredTags`: Custom capability tags

**Automatic Failover**:
- Health criteria: status, heartbeat recency, success rate
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures
- Transparent failover to backup providers
- Excluded providers list for retry logic

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/routing/select` - Select provider with policy
- `GET /api/v1/routing/policies` - List available policies

### 3.2 Authentication & Authorization System (NEW v1.0)

**Purpose**: Secure multi-user deployments with role-based access control

**Key Files**:
- `internal/auth/manager.go`
- `internal/auth/middleware.go`
- `internal/auth/handlers.go`
- `internal/auth/models.go`

**Authentication Methods**:
1. **JWT Bearer Tokens**: For user sessions (24h expiration)
2. **API Keys**: For service-to-service integrations

**User Roles**:
- `admin`: Full system access (*:* permissions)
- `user`: Read/write access to most resources
- `viewer`: Read-only access
- `service`: Custom permissions per API key

**Permissions**:
Format: `<resource>:<action>` (e.g., `agents:read`, `beads:write`)
- Resources: agents, beads, providers, projects, decisions, repl, system
- Actions: read, write, delete, admin
- Wildcards: `*:*`, `agents:*`

**Per-User Provider Isolation**:
- Providers have `owner_id` and `is_shared` fields
- Users see only their providers + shared providers
- Query: `WHERE owner_id = ? OR is_shared = 1 OR owner_id IS NULL`

**User Management UI**:
- Admin-only "Users" tab for user CRUD
- Role assignment with visual badges
- API key generation with one-time display
- Secure key revocation

**API Endpoints**:

### 13. Motivation System (NEW v1.2)

**Purpose**: Proactively trigger agent workflows based on events, time, thresholds, and system state

**Key Files**:
- `internal/motivation/engine.go` - Core trigger evaluation engine
- `internal/motivation/registry.go` - Motivation storage and CRUD
- `internal/motivation/evaluators.go` - 5 evaluator types (calendar, event, threshold, idle, external)
- `internal/motivation/idle_detector.go` - System/project/agent idle detection
- `internal/motivation/defaults.go` - 34 built-in motivations for 12 agent roles
- `internal/api/handlers_motivations.go` - REST API endpoints
- `internal/api/handlers_webhooks.go` - GitHub webhook integration

**Concepts**:
- **Motivation**: A trigger that can wake an agent or create work
- **Evaluator**: Logic to determine when a motivation should fire
- **Cooldown**: Minimum time between triggers to prevent storms
- **Stimulus Bead**: Work item automatically created when motivation fires

**Motivation Types**:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `calendar` | Time-based triggers | Deadline approaching, quarter boundary, scheduled interval |
| `event` | System event triggers | Bead completed, decision pending, release published |
| `threshold` | Metric-based triggers | Cost exceeded, coverage dropped, test failure |
| `idle` | Activity-based triggers | System idle, project idle, agent idle |
| `external` | Webhook triggers | GitHub issue opened, PR opened, comment added |

**Default Motivations by Role**:
- **CEO**: System idle → strategic review, Decision pending → executive approval
- **CFO**: Budget exceeded → cost analysis, Monthly review
- **Project Manager**: Deadline approaching/passed, Velocity drop
- **Engineering Manager**: Test failure, Coverage drop
- **QA Engineer**: Bead completed → review, Test failure → investigation
- **DevOps Engineer**: Release approaching → infrastructure prep
- **And 6 more roles...**

**Workflow**:
1. Motivation engine evaluates all registered motivations on heartbeat (30s)
2. Each evaluator checks its condition against current system state
3. If condition met and cooldown elapsed, motivation fires
4. Fire actions: wake agent, create stimulus bead, publish event
5. Cooldown period prevents re-triggering until elapsed

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/v1/motivations` - List motivations with filters
- `POST /api/v1/motivations/{id}/enable` - Enable motivation
- `POST /api/v1/motivations/{id}/disable` - Disable motivation
- `POST /api/v1/motivations/{id}/trigger` - Manual trigger
- `GET /api/v1/motivations/history` - Trigger history
- `GET /api/v1/motivations/idle` - Current idle state
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/github` - GitHub webhook receiver

**Database**: `motivations` table with type, condition, cooldown, priority; `motivation_triggers` table for history; `milestones` table for deadline tracking

See [docs/MOTIVATION_SYSTEM.md](MOTIVATION_SYSTEM.md) for complete reference.
