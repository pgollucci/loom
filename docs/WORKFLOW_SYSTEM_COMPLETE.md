## System Architecture

### Workflow Definition (YAML)
```yaml
id: "wf-bug-default"
name: "Bug Fix Workflow"
workflow_type: "bug"

nodes:
  - node_key: "investigate"
    node_type: "task"
    role_required: "QA"
    max_attempts: 3

  - node_key: "pm_review"
    node_type: "approval"
    role_required: "Product Manager"

  - node_key: "apply_fix"
    node_type: "task"
    role_required: "Engineering Manager"

edges:
  - from_node_key: ""
    to_node_key: "investigate"
    condition: "success"

  - from_node_key: "investigate"
    to_node_key: "pm_review"
    condition: "success"

  - from_node_key: "pm_review"
    to_node_key: "apply_fix"
    condition: "approved"

  - from_node_key: "pm_review"
    to_node_key: "investigate"
    condition: "rejected"
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Workflow definitions
workflows (id, name, description, workflow_type, is_default, project_id, ...)

-- Nodes in workflow
workflow_nodes (id, workflow_id, node_key, node_type, role_required, max_attempts, ...)

-- Edges between nodes
workflow_edges (id, workflow_id, from_node_key, to_node_key, condition, priority, ...)

-- Active executions
workflow_executions (id, workflow_id, bead_id, current_node_key, status, cycle_count, ...)

-- History audit trail
workflow_execution_history (id, execution_id, node_key, agent_id, condition, result_data, ...)
```

### Execution Flow
```
Bead Created → Workflow Started → Node 1 (Role: QA)
                                       ↓
                        Agent Matched by Role ← Dispatcher
                                       ↓
                            Task Executed ← Agent
                                       ↓
                     Workflow Advanced → Node 2 (Role: PM)
                                       ↓
                        Agent Matched by Role ← Dispatcher
                                       ↓
                            Task Executed ← Agent
                                       ↓
                     Approval Decision ← Agent
                        ↙          ↘
                   Approved      Rejected
                        ↓            ↓
                   Continue    Loop Back to Node 1
```

### Edge Conditions
| Condition | Trigger | Typical Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| success | Task completed | Most task nodes |
| failure | Task failed | Error handling |
| approved | Approval granted | Approval nodes |
| rejected | Approval denied | Revision loops |
| timeout | Time limit exceeded | Stale workflows |
| escalated | Max cycles/attempts | CEO intervention |

## Default Workflows

### Bug Fix Workflow
**Type:** bug
**Flow:** QA investigate → PM review → Eng Manager fix → Eng Manager commit

**Cycle Detection:** After 3 cycles (investigate → review → investigate), escalates to CEO

**Use Case:** Auto-filed bugs, error reports, production issues

### Feature Development Workflow
**Type:** feature
**Flow:** CEO review → PM plan → PM approve → Eng Manager implement → Eng Manager commit → QA verify

**Cycle Detection:** After 3 cycles, escalates to CEO

**Use Case:** New features, enhancements, product requests

### UI/Design Workflow
**Type:** ui
**Flow:** Web Designer investigate → PM review → Web Designer implement → Web Designer commit → QA verify

**Cycle Detection:** After 3 cycles, escalates to CEO

**Use Case:** UI bugs, design improvements, visual issues

## Key Features

### 1. Role-Based Routing
Beads automatically routed to agents with required role:
- QA for investigation
- Product Manager for review/approval
- Engineering Manager for fixes/commits
- Web Designer for UI changes

### 2. Cycle Detection
Workflows track complete cycles through the DAG:
- Detects when workflow loops back to previously visited nodes
- Escalates after 3 complete cycles
- Prevents infinite loops while allowing reasonable retries

### 3. Approval Mechanism
Agents can approve or reject at approval nodes:
```json
// Approve and proceed
{"type": "approve_bead", "bead_id": "ac-123", "reason": "Looks good"}

// Reject and loop back
{"type": "reject_bead", "bead_id": "ac-123", "reason": "Need more details"}
```

### 4. Escalation Infrastructure
When workflow gets stuck (3+ cycles or max attempts):
- Workflow marked as "escalated"
- Bead context updated with escalation info
- Escalation info includes workflow history, metrics, action options
- CEO can review and provide guidance

### 5. History Tracking
Every workflow state change recorded:
- Node executed
- Agent who executed it
- Condition that was satisfied
- Result data
- Attempt number

### 6. Workflow Type Detection
Automatic workflow selection based on bead:
- "feature", "enhancement" → feature workflow
- "ui", "design", "css", "html" → ui workflow
- Everything else → bug workflow

## What's Working

✅ Database schema created and migrated
✅ Workflow engine traverses DAGs correctly
✅ Default workflows load at startup
✅ Workflows auto-start for new beads
✅ Role-based agent matching
✅ Workflow advances on success/failure
✅ Approval/rejection actions work
✅ Cycle detection tracks loops
✅ Escalation marks beads for CEO review
✅ History tracks all state changes
✅ Workflow state persists in database

## Known Limitations

### 1. Agent Role Matching
**Issue:** Most agents have empty Role field
**Impact:** Falls back to persona matching
**Fix:** Set agent roles during creation based on persona

### 2. CEO Bead Auto-Creation
**Status:** Detection working, creation framework exists
**Impact:** Manual intervention needed for escalated workflows
**Fix:** Add background job to create CEO escalation beads

### 3. Commit Node Enforcement
**Status:** Defined but not enforced
**Impact:** Any agent can execute commit nodes
**Fix:** Add role enforcement in dispatcher for commit nodes

### 4. Timeout Enforcement
**Status:** Configured but not checked
**Impact:** Nodes can run indefinitely
**Fix:** Add timeout checker in workflow engine

### 5. Project-Specific Workflows
**Status:** Only default workflows active
**Impact:** Can't customize per project
**Fix:** Implement project override logic

## Performance Impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Startup time increase | ~500ms (workflow loading) |
| Dispatch overhead | ~10ms per dispatch (workflow check) |
| Database queries per dispatch | +2-3 (workflow lookup, execution check) |
| Storage per bead | +1 workflow_execution row, ~5 history rows |
| Memory footprint | Negligible (~1MB for 100 active workflows) |

## Testing

### Startup Verification
```bash
docker logs agenticorp 2>&1 | grep Workflow
```

Expected:
```
[Workflow] Loaded workflow: Bug Fix Workflow (wf-bug-default)
[Workflow] Loaded workflow: Feature Development Workflow (wf-feature-default)
[Workflow] Loaded workflow: UI/Design Workflow (wf-ui-default)
[Workflow] Installed default workflow: Bug Fix Workflow
[Workflow] Installed default workflow: Feature Development Workflow

```

### Workflow Execution
```bash
# Create test bead
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/beads \
  -d '{"title":"[Test] Bug","type":"task","priority":1,"project_id":"agenticorp-self"}'

# Watch workflow activity
docker logs --follow agenticorp | grep "\[Workflow\]"
```

Expected:
```
[Workflow] Started workflow Bug Fix Workflow for bead ac-XXXX
[Workflow] Bead ac-XXXX requires role: QA
[Workflow] Matched bead ac-XXXX to agent qa-1 by workflow role QA
[Workflow] Advanced workflow for bead ac-XXXX: status=active, node=pm_review, cycle=0
```

## Database Queries

```sql
-- View all workflows
SELECT id, name, workflow_type, is_default FROM workflows;

-- View workflow nodes
SELECT node_key, node_type, role_required, max_attempts
FROM workflow_nodes
WHERE workflow_id = 'wf-bug-default';

-- View active workflow executions
SELECT bead_id, current_node_key, status, cycle_count, node_attempt_count
FROM workflow_executions
WHERE status = 'active';

-- View workflow history for a bead
SELECT node_key, agent_id, condition, attempt_number, created_at
FROM workflow_execution_history weh
JOIN workflow_executions we ON weh.execution_id = we.id
WHERE we.bead_id = 'ac-1234'
ORDER BY created_at;

-- Find escalated workflows
SELECT bead_id, workflow_id, escalation_reason, escalated_at
FROM workflow_executions
WHERE status = 'escalated';
