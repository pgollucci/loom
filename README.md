# Arbiter

An AI Coding Agent Orchestrator for both on-prem and off-prem development.

Arbiter is a lightweight AI coding agent orchestrator, dispatcher, and automatic decision maker. Instead of being just another frontend to systems like Claude or Cursor, Arbiter intelligently routes requests to multiple AI providers and presents a unified OpenAI-compatible API.

## Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Provider Support**: Configure and use multiple AI providers (Claude, OpenAI, Cursor, Factory, and more)
- 🔒 **Secure Secret Storage**: API keys are encrypted and stored securely, never committed to git
- 🌐 **Dual Interface**: Both OpenAI-compatible REST API and web frontend
- 🔍 **Automatic Provider Discovery**: Looks up API endpoints for known providers or accepts custom URLs
- ⚡ **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, runs as a background service
- 🎯 **Smart Routing**: Automatically routes requests to appropriate providers

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher (tested with Go 1.24)

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordanhubbard/arbiter.git
cd arbiter
go build
```

This will create an `arbiter` binary in the current directory.

## Quick Start

1. **Run Arbiter**:
   ```bash
   ./arbiter
   ```

2. **First-time Setup**: On first run, Arbiter will interactively guide you through configuring your AI providers:
   - Enter the names of providers you have access to (e.g., `claude, openai, cursor`)
   - For each provider, either:
     - Provide a specific API endpoint URL, or
     - Let Arbiter look up the standard endpoint for known providers
   - Enter your API key for each provider

3. **Access the Interfaces**:
   - **Web UI**: http://localhost:8080
   - **OpenAI-compatible API**: http://localhost:8080/v1/...
   - **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/health

## Configuration

Arbiter stores configuration in two files in your home directory:

- `~/.arbiter.json`: Provider configurations (endpoints, names)
- `~/.arbiter_secrets`: Encrypted API keys (machine-specific encryption)

**Security Note**: These files are never committed to git. The secrets file uses AES-GCM encryption with a machine-specific key derived from hostname and user directory.

## API Endpoints

Arbiter provides an OpenAI-compatible API:

### Chat Completions
```bash
POST /v1/chat/completions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "claude-default",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
  ]
}
```

### Text Completions
```bash
POST /v1/completions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "openai-default",
  "prompt": "Once upon a time"
}
```

### List Models
```bash
GET /v1/models
```

### Health Check
```bash
GET /health
```

### List Providers
```bash
GET /api/providers
```

## Usage Examples

### Using with curl

```bash
# Chat completion
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-default",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about coding"}]
  }'

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

### Using with Python OpenAI Client

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Point the client to Arbiter
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1",
    api_key="not-needed"  # Arbiter manages keys
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-default",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Supported Providers

Arbiter has built-in support for the following providers with automatic endpoint lookup:

- **Claude** (Anthropic): `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`
- **OpenAI**: `https://api.openai.com/v1`
- **Cursor**: `https://api.cursor.sh/v1`
- **Factory**: `https://api.factory.ai/v1`
- **Cohere**: `https://api.cohere.ai/v1`
- **HuggingFace**: `https://api-inference.huggingface.co`
- **Replicate**: `https://api.replicate.com/v1`
- **Together**: `https://api.together.xyz/v1`
- **Mistral**: `https://api.mistral.ai/v1`
- **Perplexity**: `https://api.perplexity.ai`

For any other provider, you can manually specify the API endpoint during setup.

## Security Considerations

- API keys are encrypted using AES-GCM with a 256-bit key
- Encryption key is derived from machine-specific data (hostname + home directory)
- Secrets file has restricted permissions (0600)
- Configuration and secrets are stored in home directory, never in repository
- No secrets are logged or exposed in API responses

# arbiter
An agentic based coding orchestrator for both on-prem and off-prem development

Arbiter is a web-based service that helps orchestrate and monitor AI agents working on coding tasks. It provides:
- Work queue management for tracking tasks
- Agent communication monitoring
- Service endpoint tracking with cost analysis
- Priority-based routing that favors fixed-cost (self-hosted) services

## Features

### Work Management
- Submit new work items via REST API
- Track work in progress
- Monitor work status and assignments

### Agent Monitoring
- View active agents and their status
- Monitor inter-agent communications
- Track which service endpoints agents are using

### Service Endpoints
- Track multiple LLM service endpoints (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, vLLM, etc.)
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Prioritize fixed-cost self-hosted services (Ollama, vLLM)
- Interactive cost management UI
- Real-time traffic monitoring

### Cost Tracking
- **Fixed-cost services**: Mark self-hosted services (Ollama, vLLM) as fixed-cost
- **Variable-cost services**: Track per-token costs for paid APIs
- **Automatic prioritization**: System prioritizes fixed-cost services to minimize expenses
- **Interactive cost editing**: Click on any service in the UI to update its cost model

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordanhubbard/arbiter.git
cd arbiter

```

3. Build the application:
```bash
go build -o arbiter ./cmd/arbiter
```

4. Run the server:

The server will start on port 8080 by default. You can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:
```bash
PORT=3000 ./arbiter
```

### Web UI

## Service Priority System

The arbiter automatically prioritizes services based on their cost model:

1. **Fixed-cost services** (e.g., self-hosted Ollama/vLLM): Highest priority
   - Zero or fixed monthly cost
   - Marked as "fixed" cost type
   - Always preferred when available

2. **Variable-cost services** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic): Lower priority
   - Pay-per-token pricing
   - Marked as "variable" cost type
   - Used when fixed-cost services are unavailable or overloaded

The `/api/services/preferred` endpoint returns services in priority order, allowing agents to select the most cost-effective service first.

## Web UI Features

### Dashboard
- Create new work items
- View work in progress
- Monitor active agents
- See agent communications
- Manage service endpoints

### Service Management
- View all services or filter by active status
- See preferred service order (fixed-cost first)
- Click any service to edit its cost model
- Real-time token usage and cost tracking
- Visual indicators for service status and cost type

### Cost Editing
Click on any service in the dashboard to:
- Switch between fixed and variable cost models
- Set fixed cost amounts
- Configure per-token pricing
- Update cost models on the fly
