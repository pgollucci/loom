- `personas/arbiter` — Arbiter-specific system persona(s)
- `personas/default/ceo` — Human CEO decision maker (tie-breaks / approvals)
- `personas/default/project-manager` — Plans work, files beads, drives delivery

## User Guide

The initial user guide is available in `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`.

## Project Registration

Projects are registered via `config.yaml` under `projects:` (and persisted in the configuration DB when enabled).

Required fields:
- `id`, `name`, `git_repo`, `branch`, `beads_path`

Optional fields:
- `is_perpetual` (never closes)
- `context` (recommended: build/test/lint commands and other agent-relevant context)

Example:

```yaml
projects:
  - id: arbiter
    name: Arbiter
    git_repo: https://github.com/jordanhubbard/arbiter
    branch: main
    beads_path: .beads
    is_perpetual: true
    context:
      test: go test ./...
      vet: go vet ./...
```

Arbiter “dogfoods” itself by registering this repo as a project and loading beads from the project’s `.beads/` directory.

## Architecture

Arbiter is built with the following principles:

- **Go-First Implementation**: All primary functionality is implemented in Go for performance and maintainability
- **Containerized Everything**: Every component runs in containers for consistency across environments
- **Temporal Workflows**: Reliable, durable workflow orchestration using Temporal
- **Event-Driven**: Real-time event bus for agent communication and UI updates

## Prerequisites

- Docker (20.10+)
- Docker Compose (1.29+)
- Go 1.24+ (for local development only)
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

## Quick Start

### Running with Docker (Recommended)

The Docker setup includes:
- Arbiter application server (port 8080)
- Temporal server (port 7233)
- Temporal UI (port 8088)
- PostgreSQL database for Temporal

```bash
# Build and run all services using docker compose
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f arbiter

# View Temporal UI
open http://localhost:8088

# Stop all services
docker compose down
```

### Using Make Commands

```bash
# Build and run
make docker-run

# Build Docker image
make docker-build

# Stop services
make docker-stop

# Clean Docker resources
make docker-clean
```

## Temporal Workflow Engine

Arbiter uses [Temporal](https://temporal.io) for reliable workflow orchestration. Temporal provides:

- **Durable Execution**: Workflows survive crashes and restarts
- **Event History**: Complete audit trail of all workflow executions
- **Signals & Queries**: Real-time workflow interaction
- **Timeout Management**: Automatic handling of long-running operations

### Temporal Components

The system includes:

1. **Temporal Server**: Core workflow engine (port 7233)
2. **Temporal UI**: Web interface for monitoring workflows (port 8088)
3. **PostgreSQL**: Persistence layer for workflow state
4. **Temporal Worker**: Executes workflow and activity code

1. Ensure all code follows the architecture principles above
2. All new features must be containerized
3. **File a bead for your work** - See [BEADS_WORKFLOW.md](BEADS_WORKFLOW.md)
4. Update documentation for any new features or changes
5. Run tests and linters before submitting changes

### Workflows

Arbiter implements several key workflows:

#### Agent Lifecycle Workflow
Manages the complete lifecycle of an agent from spawn to shutdown:
- Tracks agent status (spawned, working, idle, shutdown)
- Handles bead assignments
- Responds to queries for current status
- Gracefully shuts down on signal

#### Bead Processing Workflow
Manages work item (bead) lifecycle:
- Tracks status transitions (open, in_progress, blocked, closed)
- Handles agent assignments
- Manages dependencies and blockers
- Provides status queries

#### Decision Workflow
Handles approval workflows with timeout:
- Creates decision points for agent questions
- Waits for human or agent approval
- 48-hour default timeout
- Unblocks dependent work on resolution

### Event Bus

The Temporal-based event bus provides real-time updates:

```
Event Types:
- agent.spawned        - New agent created
- agent.status_change  - Agent status updated
- agent.completed      - Agent finished work
- bead.created         - New work item created
- bead.assigned        - Work assigned to agent
- bead.status_change   - Work status updated
- bead.completed       - Work item finished
- decision.created     - Decision point created
- decision.resolved    - Decision made
- log.message          - System log message
```

### Event Streaming (NEW)

Real-time event streaming via Server-Sent Events:

```

Example: Subscribe to events using curl:
```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events/stream
```

Example: Subscribe to events using JavaScript:
```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events/stream?project_id=my-project');

eventSource.addEventListener('agent.spawned', (e) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
  console.log('Agent spawned:', data);
});

eventSource.addEventListener('bead.created', (e) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
  console.log('Bead created:', data);
});
```

## Project State Management

Arbiter supports sophisticated project lifecycle management:

### Project States
- **Open**: Active project with ongoing work
- **Closed**: Completed project with no remaining work
- **Reopened**: Previously closed project that has been reopened

### Features
- **Comments**: Add timestamped comments to track project decisions
- **Closure Workflow**: Close projects only when no open work remains
- **Agent Consensus**: If open work exists, requires agent agreement to close
- **Perpetual Projects**: Mark projects (like Arbiter itself) that never close

### API Endpoints

```bash
# Close a project
POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/close
{
  "author_id": "agent-123",
  "comment": "All features complete, tests passing"
}

# Reopen a project
POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/reopen
{
  "author_id": "agent-456",
  "comment": "New requirements discovered"
}

# Add a comment
POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/comments
{
  "author_id": "agent-789",
  "comment": "Architecture review complete"
}

# Get project state
GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/state
```

## The Arbiter Persona

The Arbiter system includes a special **arbiter** persona that works on improving the Arbiter platform itself:

- **Self-Improving**: Continuously enhances the platform
- **Collaborative**: Works with UX, Engineering, PM, and Product personas
- **Perpetual**: The arbiter project never closes
- **Meta-Circular**: An AI orchestrator that orchestrates its own improvement

See `personas/arbiter/` for the complete persona definition.

## Monitoring

### Temporal UI

Access the Temporal UI at http://localhost:8088 to:
- View workflow executions
- Inspect workflow history
- Monitor active workflows
- Debug workflow failures
- Query workflow state

### Event Stream Monitoring

Monitor real-time events:
```bash
# Watch all events
curl -N http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events/stream

# Monitor specific project
curl -N "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/events/stream?project_id=my-project"
```

### Logs

View service logs:
```bash
# All services
docker compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker compose logs -f arbiter
docker compose logs -f temporal
```

## Troubleshooting

### Temporal Connection Issues

If arbiter can't connect to Temporal:

1. Check Temporal is running:
```bash
docker compose ps temporal
```

2. Check Temporal logs:
```bash
docker compose logs temporal
```

3. Verify connectivity:
```bash
docker exec arbiter nc -zv temporal 7233
```

### Workflow Not Starting

If workflows aren't starting:

1. Check worker is running:
```bash
docker compose logs arbiter | grep "Temporal worker"
```

2. Verify task queue in Temporal UI
3. Check workflow registration in logs

### Event Stream Not Working

If event stream endpoint returns errors:

1. Verify Temporal is enabled in config
2. Check event bus initialization:
```bash
docker compose logs arbiter | grep "event bus"
```
