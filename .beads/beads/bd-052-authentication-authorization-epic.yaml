title: Authentication and Authorization System
description: |
  Implement authentication and authorization to enable secure multi-user deployments
  and safe cloud hosting of AgentiCorp instances.
  
  Problem: AgentiCorp currently has no authentication, making it unsafe to expose 
  beyond localhost. This limits deployment options and prevents team usage.
  
  Goals:
  - Add API key authentication for REST endpoints
  - Support multiple authentication methods (API keys, OAuth, JWT)
  - Implement role-based access control (admin, user, read-only)
  - Add user management interface
  - Secure provider credentials per user/team
  
  Success Criteria:
  - Endpoints require authentication by default
  - Multiple users can have separate provider credentials
  - Admin can manage user permissions
  - Failed auth attempts are logged
  - Compatible with reverse proxy authentication
  
  User Impact: Enables team deployments and safe cloud hosting.
