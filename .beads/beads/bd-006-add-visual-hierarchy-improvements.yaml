title: Enhance visual hierarchy and consistency
description: |
  Improve the visual design of the AgentiCorp interface with better hierarchy,
  spacing, and consistency across components.
  
  Current issues:
  - Inconsistent spacing and padding across sections
  - Bead cards in kanban could use more breathing room
  - Agent cards and persona cards have different styling approaches
  - Priority colors (P0, P1) could be more prominent
  - Agent status badges could be larger/more visible
  - Decision beads blend in with regular beads
  - Navigation links are small and blend into header
  - No active section indication
  
  Improvements:
  - Establish consistent spacing scale (8px grid system)
  - Make priority indicators more prominent
  - Enhance visual differentiation between card types
  - Improve navigation visibility and add active state
  - Add smooth scrolling to sections
  - Unify card styling across components
  
  Files to modify:
  - web/static/css/style.css
  - web/static/index.html (may need structure adjustments)
