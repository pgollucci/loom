title: P0 - CEO REPL for high-priority Arbiter queries
description: |
  Add a CEO-facing REPL at the bottom of the UI to send high-priority
  questions directly to Arbiter through Temporal.

  Requirements
  - Add a CEO REPL section in the UI with textarea input and response display.
  - Route queries through Temporal as a high-priority workflow.
  - Use Arbiter persona context and select the best provider by quality/latency.
  - Surface provider/model metadata in the response.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - CEO can submit a query and receive a response in the UI.
  - Requests run through Temporal workflows (not direct provider calls).
  - Provider selection favors high-quality, low-latency providers.
