title: P1 (sticky) User guide review by personas before release approval
description: |
    This is a sticky, always-on bead for the Loom project.

    Goal
    - Ensure the Loom user guide is reviewed and augmented by relevant personas
      before any release can be approved by release engineers.

    Rules
    1) Release gating
       - A release cannot be approved unless the user guide has been reviewed and
         updated as needed.
    2) Required reviewers
       - At minimum: documentation-manager, project-manager, and qa-engineer.
       - Additional personas should be included when their domain is impacted
         (e.g., devops-engineer for deployment changes).
    3) Evidence
       - Each release must include a short note in the release checklist or bead
         context confirming the review occurred and describing any updates made.

    Definition of Done (for any release bead)
    - The user guide has been reviewed by the required personas.
    - The guide is updated to reflect any changes in workflows or features.
    - Release approval includes the review evidence.
