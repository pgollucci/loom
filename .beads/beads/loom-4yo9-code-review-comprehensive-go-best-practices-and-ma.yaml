title: '[Code Review] Comprehensive Go best practices and maintainability audit'
description: |-
    Conduct a comprehensive code review of the entire Loom codebase focusing on:

    **Go Language Best Practices:**
    - Idiomatic Go code patterns
    - Proper error handling
    - Effective use of interfaces
    - Concurrency patterns and goroutine safety
    - Resource cleanup and defer usage

    **Code Maintainability:**
    - Clear and concise code
    - Consistent naming conventions
    - Appropriate function/method sizes
    - Code duplication elimination
    - Documentation and comments quality

    **Architecture Analysis:**
    - Circular dependencies detection
    - Package structure and organization
    - Separation of concerns
    - Coupling and cohesion analysis

    **Specific Concerns:**
    - Look for circular operations (functions calling each other in loops)
    - Identify circular package dependencies
    - Find redundant or unnecessary code paths
    - Check for potential performance bottlenecks

    **Deliverables:**
    1. Create detailed findings document: docs/CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md
    2. File specific improvement beads for each significant issue found
    3. Prioritize findings by impact (P1 for critical, P2 for important, P3 for nice-to-have)
    4. Provide refactoring recommendations with code examples

    **Scope:**
    - All Go code in internal/, pkg/, and cmd/ directories
    - Focus on core systems: dispatch, agents, workflow, beads, providers

    This is a self-improvement task - Loom reviewing and improving itself.
