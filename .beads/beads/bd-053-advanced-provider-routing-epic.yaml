title: Advanced Provider Routing Logic
description: |
  Implement intelligent provider selection based on cost, latency, and capabilities
  to optimize for best results at lowest cost.
  
  Problem: Current provider selection is manual and doesn't optimize for cost or 
  performance. Users may unknowingly use expensive providers for simple tasks.
  
  Goals:
  - Implement cost-aware routing (prefer cheaper providers)
  - Add latency monitoring and low-latency routing
  - Support capability-based routing (route based on model features)
  - Create routing policies (e.g., "minimize cost", "minimize latency", "maximize quality")
  - Add automatic failover to backup providers
  
  Success Criteria:
  - Can route requests based on configurable policies
  - Tracks provider performance metrics
  - Automatically fails over when providers are unavailable
  - Reduces costs by 30%+ compared to naive routing
  - User can override routing policy per request
  
  User Impact: Users save money and get better performance automatically.
