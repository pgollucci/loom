title: P0 - Document default personas and project registration in README.md
description: |
  Update README.md (near the top) to clearly document:

  1) Default personas
     - List all default personas shipped with the repository
     - Describe what each is for and when to use it
     - Link to their persona definitions under ./personas

  2) Project registration model
     - Explain how a project is registered with Arbiter
       - Via config.yaml projects[]
       - Required fields: id, name, git_repo, branch, beads_path
       - Optional fields: is_perpetual, context (build/test/lint commands)
     - Explain that Arbiter dogfoods itself by registering the Arbiter repo as a project
     - Describe how beads are discovered/loaded from .beads for registered projects

  Rationale
  - This is a core architectural mechanism for how the system works and should be
    immediately visible to new users.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - README.md includes a "Default Personas" section near the top
  - README.md includes a "Project Registration" section near the top
  - Sections are concise, accurate, and link to deeper docs where appropriate
