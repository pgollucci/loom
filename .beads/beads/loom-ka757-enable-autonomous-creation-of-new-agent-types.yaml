title: Enable autonomous creation of new agent types
description: 'Add the ability for loom to autonomously create entirely new agent types when best practices evolve or new needs are discovered. This should include: 1) A persona template system that agents can use to define new persona files, 2) A validation step to ensure new personas don''t overlap >90% with existing ones, 3) Auto-registration of new agent types into the worker pool, 4) A governance workflow where the CEO agent approves new agent type creation, 5) Persistence of newly created personas to the project''s personas directory. The entire flow should be fully autonomous - no human intervention required.'
