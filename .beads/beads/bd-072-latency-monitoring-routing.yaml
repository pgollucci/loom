title: Add latency monitoring and low-latency routing
description: |
  Track provider latency metrics and route requests to low-latency providers
  when speed is prioritized.
  
  Tasks:
  - Implement latency tracking per provider
  - Store rolling latency metrics
  - Create low-latency routing strategy
  - Add latency reporting to UI
  - Handle latency-cost tradeoffs
  
  Acceptance:
  - Latency tracked per provider (p50, p95, p99)
  - Routing can optimize for latency
  - Latency metrics visible in UI
  - Fast routing decision (<100ms)
  - Strategy handles unavailable providers
