title: Response Caching Layer
description: |
  Implement intelligent response caching to save money on duplicate requests and 
  provide faster responses for common queries.
  
  Problem: Identical or similar requests result in redundant API calls, wasting 
  money and time.
  
  Goals:
  - Implement intelligent response caching
  - Cache based on request similarity (exact match, semantic similarity)
  - Configurable cache TTL and size limits
  - Cache invalidation policies
  - Respect provider-specific caching rules
  - Optional Redis backend for distributed caching
  
  Success Criteria:
  - Cache hit reduces cost to zero for that request
  - Cache responses return in <50ms
  - Cache hit rate >20% for typical usage
  - Users can control caching per request
  - Stale data is never returned
  
  User Impact: Reduced costs and faster responses for common queries.
