title: '[CEO] Code Fix Approval: SSH Key and Beads Directory Creation for loom-self'
description: |-
    ## Code Fix Proposal

    **Original Bug:** loom-278e3

    ### Root Cause Analysis
    The project readiness check failed because:
    1. Git remote access failed due to missing SSH key verification
    2. The beads directory at data/projects/loom-self/.beads is missing

    ### Proposed Fix
    1. Create the necessary directory structure for the loom-self project
    2. Create the .beads directory to satisfy project readiness requirements
    3. Ensure SSH key is properly configured for git access

    ### Changes Required
    The fix requires creating the directory structure and .beads directory. No code changes are needed, but infrastructure setup is required.

    ### Risk Assessment
    **Risk Level:** Low
    **Side Effects:** None expected - only directory creation
    **Testing:** Directory structure verification and bead functionality check

    ### Recommendation
    I recommend approval because this is an infrastructure setup issue required for project readiness, not a code defect. The fix involves creating necessary directories and does not impact existing functionality. This is a prerequisite for all future development on the loom-self project.
