First step is to check the git status to assess the current state of the repository, particularly whether SSH access issues are preventing operations. This will help determine if we need to configure SSH or if the issue is elsewhere. Since the bead involves project readiness failure due to git remote access failure, verifying connectivity and configuration is critical before proceeding with any code changes."
