    agent_output: '{"action": "done", "reason": "Unable to complete the task due to a read-only file system preventing SSH configuration changes. The root filesystem is mounted read-only, which prevents creating or modifying the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file needed for SSH host key verification. This is an infrastructure limitation that cannot be resolved through code changes. The original issue requires either: 1) Remounting the filesystem as read-write, 2) Using a different authentication method (like HTTPS with tokens), or 3) Pre-configuring the SSH known_hosts in the container/environment setup. Recommend escalating to infrastructure team to resolve the read-only filesystem constraint.", "notes": "After multiple iterations attempting various approaches to add GitHub''s SSH host key to known_hosts, all attempts failed with ''Read-only file system'' error. The task cannot be completed without infrastructure changes to allow write access to the SSH configuration directory."}'
