title: P0 - Make build/run/test targets exercise full Docker stack
description: |
  The current Makefile build/run/test targets run the arbiter binary directly.
  We need these targets to build, run, and test the full Docker stack (including
  Temporal and any required services) so we are not running in a crippled mode.

  Requirements
  - Update build/run/test targets to use docker-compose (or equivalent) to build
    and run the full container stack.
  - Ensure tests run with Temporal and other dependencies available.
  - Preserve developer convenience while making the default targets validate
    the full system.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - `make build`, `make run`, and `make test` exercise the containerized stack.
  - Temporal is running during test execution.
  - The targets provide clear logs and failure output.
