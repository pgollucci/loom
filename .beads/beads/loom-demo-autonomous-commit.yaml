title: '[Self-Improvement] Demonstrate autonomous commit capability'
description: |-
    Create a simple demonstration that Loom can autonomously fix issues and commit changes.

    Task: Add a comment to the README.md file demonstrating autonomous operation

    Steps:
    1. Read README.md
    2. Add a comment at the top: "<!-- Autonomous agent capability enabled 2026-02-15 -->"
    3. Test that the change is valid
    4. Commit with message: "feat: add autonomous agent marker to README"
    5. Report success

    This demonstrates the complete autonomous workflow:
    - Agent receives task from workflow
    - Agent makes code changes
    - Agent creates git commit with agent attribution
    - Commit shows in git log as autonomous agent work

    Expected result: Git log shows commit by agent, not human author
