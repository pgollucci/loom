title: Replace alert() dialogs with proper modal components
description: |
  Replace all browser alert() calls with proper modal dialogs for better UX.
  Currently, bead details and errors are shown using alert(), which is jarring
  and provides a poor user experience.
  
  Key improvements:
  - Create a reusable modal component for displaying bead/decision details
  - Replace alert() error messages with toast notifications
  - Add loading states for all async operations
  - Implement success/error feedback for form submissions
  - Show visual feedback when spawning agents or performing actions
  
  This will provide a more modern and user-friendly interface.
  
  Files to modify:
  - web/static/js/app.js
  - web/static/index.html (add modal templates)
  - web/static/css/style.css (add toast notification styles)
