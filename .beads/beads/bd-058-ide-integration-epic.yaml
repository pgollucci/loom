description: |
  Create plugins for popular IDEs to enable developers to use AgentiCorp directly 
  from their editor without context switching.
  
  Problem: Users must leave their IDE to interact with AgentiCorp through web UI 
  or separate tools.
  
  Goals:
  - Create VS Code extension
  - Create JetBrains plugin
  - Create Neovim/Vim plugin
  - Provide extension API for other IDEs
  
  Sub-features to implement:
  - VS Code extension with AI chat panel
  - Inline code suggestions from AgentiCorp
  - JetBrains plugin
  - Vim/Neovim integration
  
  Success Criteria: Developers can access AgentiCorp features without leaving 
  their editor.
  
  User Impact: Seamless integration into developer workflows.
