title: Improve mobile responsive design and touch targets
description: |
  Enhance the mobile experience of the AgentiCorp web interface with better
  responsive design and appropriate touch targets.
  
  Current issues:
  - Kanban columns are very tall on mobile when stacked
  - Touch targets may be too small (buttons, cards)
  - Modal dialogs may not fit well on small screens
  - Abrupt breakpoint transition at 768px
  - Tables and long text may overflow on small screens
  
  Improvements:
  - Add intermediate breakpoints for tablet sizes
  - Ensure minimum touch target size of 44x44px
  - Make grid layouts more fluid
  - Improve modal sizing on small screens
  - Test and optimize for common mobile devices
  - Consider collapsible sections for long content on mobile
  
  Files to modify:
  - web/static/css/style.css (responsive styles and breakpoints)
