title: Load Balancing and High Availability
description: |
  Enable distributed deployment of AgentiCorp for high load handling and redundancy.
  
  Problem: Single AgentiCorp instance becomes a bottleneck and single point of failure.
  
  Goals:
  - Support distributed deployment
  - Shared state via external database (Redis/PostgreSQL)
  - Load balancer integration
  - Health check endpoints
  - Graceful shutdown and startup
  - Session affinity options
  
  Success Criteria:
  - Multiple instances can run concurrently
  - State is synchronized across instances
  - Health checks accurately report status
  - Zero-downtime deployments possible
  - Scales horizontally under load
  
  User Impact: Enterprise users can deploy AgentiCorp at scale with high availability.
