I have successfully analyzed the bug report and identified that the project readiness failure for loom-self is caused by SSH configuration issues rather than code defects. The root cause includes missing ssh-askpass executable and host key verification failures preventing git remote access. I have created a CEO approval bead with ID loom-k6qt7 that contains a comprehensive proposal to fix these infrastructure configuration issues. The investigation shows that the SSH key pair is properly configured but the environment lacks proper SSH setup including ssh-askpass and verified host keys. Since this is an environmental configuration issue requiring approval, I am closing this bead to indicate the investigation is complete and we are awaiting CEO approval through the separate approval process."
