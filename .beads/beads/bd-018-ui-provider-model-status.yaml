title: "P2 - UI: show provider configured/selected model, score, and optional GPU"
description: |
  Extend the Web UI to surface provider model negotiation state.

  Requirements
  - Provider cards/details should show:
    - configured_model (requested)
    - selected_model (effective)
    - selection reason
    - current score + last observed metrics (if available)
    - selected GPU (if reported)
  - Provide a UI action to trigger negotiation:
    - "Re-negotiate model" button calling the API trigger.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - UI clearly differentiates configured vs selected model.
  - Negotiation trigger works and updates UI via SSE events (or refresh).
