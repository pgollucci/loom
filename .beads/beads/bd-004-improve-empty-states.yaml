title: Create informative empty states with call-to-action buttons
description: |
  Improve the user experience when there is no data to display by creating
  informative empty states with helpful actions.
  
  Current issues:
  - "No active agents", "No pending decisions" are just plain text
  - No guidance for first-time users on what to do next
  - Missing visual illustrations or helpful prompts
  
  Improvements:
  - Add "Spawn your first agent" button in empty agents section
  - Include helpful text explaining what each section is for
  - Add visual icons or illustrations to empty states
  - Provide quick start guidance for new users
  - Link to documentation where appropriate
  
  Files to modify:
  - web/static/js/app.js (render functions for empty states)
  - web/static/css/style.css (empty state styling)
  - web/static/index.html (if needed)
