However, git does not track changes to the .git/config file as it is part of the git metadata, not the working tree. The change has been applied and verified, but it cannot be committed as a regular file change. The SSH configuration is now correct, and the project should be able to access the remote repository using SSH.", "notes": "Thought: The .git/config file is not tracked by git, so changes to it cannot be committed.
