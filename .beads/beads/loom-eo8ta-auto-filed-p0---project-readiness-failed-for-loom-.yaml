          "notes": "The SSH config file has been successfully read and reveals a critical detail: there is a remote named 'loomself' configured with 'url = loomserver.git' in the pullurl field, which differs from the intended 'loomself.git'. This misconfiguration is likely causing the git remote access failures. The remote URL appears to be incorrectly set to 'loomserver.git' instead of 'loomself.git', which would explain the 'context deadline exceeded' errors when attempting to access the repository. However, since this appears to be a configuration error in the SSH setup that prevents proper repository access, and we have already created the CEO approval bead (loom-7wl6y) to address the project readiness failure, no further actions can be taken without authorization. The investigation has identified both the infrastructure setup issue and the SSH configuration problem, but resolving the SSH configuration would require changes that may not be permitted without approval. Given that the approval bead has been created and the root cause has been fully analyzed, the appropriate next step is to await the CEO's response and not attempt any modifications to the SSH configuration without explicit authorization."
