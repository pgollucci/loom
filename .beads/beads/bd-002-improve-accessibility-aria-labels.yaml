  and improving semantic HTML structure throughout the application.
  
  Key improvements needed:
  - Add ARIA labels to navigation links for screen readers
  - Add proper ARIA roles and focus management to modal dialogs
  - Ensure all form inputs have associated labels
  - Add skip navigation link for keyboard users
  - Verify all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
  - Add visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
  
  This addresses WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements.
