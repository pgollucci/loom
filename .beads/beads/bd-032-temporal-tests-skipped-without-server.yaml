title: P0 - Temporal tests skipped because Temporal is not running
description: |
  Running `make test` shows Temporal-related tests are skipped because the
  Temporal server is not available. This indicates the tests are not exercising
  the full system.

  Evidence
  - internal/temporal tests skipped with errors like:
    "failed reaching server: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:7233: connect: connection refused"
  - internal/temporal/eventbus tests skipped for the same reason.

  Requirements
  - Ensure Temporal is running during test execution (via docker compose or
    a test harness) so these tests run instead of skipping.
  - Update test setup to fail fast if Temporal is expected but not available.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - Temporal-related tests run and pass during `make test`.
  - The test suite fails if Temporal cannot be reached when required.
