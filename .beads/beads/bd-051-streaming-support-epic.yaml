title: Real-time Response Streaming Support
description: |
  Implement streaming support for real-time AI responses using Server-Sent Events
  (SSE) or WebSocket, improving perceived performance and user experience.
  
  Problem: Currently, users must wait for complete responses before seeing any 
  output, leading to poor perceived performance.
  
  Goals:
  - Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSocket support
  - Add streaming handlers for provider responses
  - Update web UI to display streaming content
  - Maintain backwards compatibility with non-streaming endpoints
  
  Success Criteria:
  - Responses begin displaying within 500ms
  - Streaming works for all configured providers
  - Fallback gracefully for providers without streaming support
  - Web UI updates smoothly without flickering
  
  User Impact: All users benefit from faster perceived response times and better 
  interactivity.
