title: Add search and filter capabilities for beads and agents
description: |
  Add search and filtering functionality to help users find and manage
  beads, agents, and other resources more effectively.
  
  Current limitations:
  - No way to search for specific beads
  - Cannot filter beads by status, priority, or tags
  - No sorting options
  - Cannot see bead relationships (parent/child, blocking)
  - Limited visibility into complex work graphs
  
  Proposed features:
  - Add search input for beads by title/description
  - Filter dropdowns for status, priority, type, and tags
  - Sort options (by date, priority, status)
  - Visual display of bead relationships
  - Quick filters (e.g., "My beads", "Blocked", "High priority")
  - Search for agents by name or persona
  
  Files to modify:
  - web/static/js/app.js (search and filter logic)
  - web/static/index.html (search/filter UI elements)
  - web/static/css/style.css (search/filter styling)
