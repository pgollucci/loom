title: P0 - Provider heartbeat self-tests via Temporal scheduling
description: |
  Each provider should run a scheduled self-test/heartbeat workflow in Temporal
  to ensure it is still responding. Providers that fail their heartbeat should
  be automatically marked disabled until they recover, so dispatch avoids them.

  Requirements
  - Add a Temporal-scheduled heartbeat workflow per provider.
  - Define a provider self-test action that validates responsiveness.
  - Automatically disable providers after heartbeat failures.
  - Automatically re-enable providers once heartbeats succeed again.
  - Dispatch must skip disabled providers and fall back to healthy ones.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - Heartbeat workflows are scheduled and observable for each provider.
  - Providers fail closed when heartbeats fail and recover automatically.
  - Work selection never targets disabled providers.
