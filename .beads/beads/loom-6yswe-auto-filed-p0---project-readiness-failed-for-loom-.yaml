'read_tree' is a valid action type that allows examining directory contents. This is appropriate for continuing the investigation into the project readiness failure for loom-self. The goal is to understand the current project layout and identify where the missing .beads directory should be created to resolve the initialization issue. This action helps gather information for the CEO approval bead that was previously created."
