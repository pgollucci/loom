title: P0 - make test must always pass
description: |
  The `make test` target should always pass in the default development and CI
  environments. This is a sticky requirement to prevent regressions that break
  the primary test workflow.

  Requirements
  - Ensure `make test` passes without manual intervention.
  - Keep this requirement sticky across future changes.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - `make test` completes successfully on a clean checkout.
  - Failures or skips are addressed or surfaced as P0 regressions.
