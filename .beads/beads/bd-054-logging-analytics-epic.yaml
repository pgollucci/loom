title: Request/Response Logging and Analytics
description: |
  Implement comprehensive logging and analytics to provide visibility into usage
  patterns, costs, and provider performance.
  
  Problem: Users have no visibility into their usage patterns, costs, or provider 
  performance over time.
  
  Goals:
  - Log all requests and responses (with privacy controls)
  - Track costs per provider and per user
  - Create analytics dashboard showing usage trends
  - Export usage data for external analysis
  - Alert on unusual spending patterns
  
  Success Criteria:
  - All requests are logged with metadata
  - Dashboard shows usage by provider, model, user, time
  - Cost tracking is accurate to provider pricing
  - Logs can be exported in standard formats
  - Privacy controls prevent sensitive data leakage
  
  User Impact: Users gain insights into spending and can optimize usage.
