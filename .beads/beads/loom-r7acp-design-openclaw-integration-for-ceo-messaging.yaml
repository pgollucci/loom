title: Design openclaw integration for CEO messaging
description: |-
    ## Overview

    Optional integration with openclaw portal so that Loom can communicate with the CEO (human) persona through messaging devices. Two-way channel:

    1. Loom → CEO: Decision requests, status updates, demo notifications, escalations
    2. CEO → Loom: Approvals, priority changes, direct instructions, feedback

    ## Design Questions

    - What is openclaw's messaging API? (investigate their portal/SDK)
    - How to map Loom's decision beads to openclaw messages?
    - How to handle CEO responses back into the bead system?
    - Per-project opt-in: project config flag to enable openclaw
    - Authentication: how to link openclaw user to Loom CEO persona
    - Message formatting: how to render bead context in messaging UI

    ## Integration Points

    - Decision workflow: when agent creates escalation → openclaw message to CEO
    - CEO approval: openclaw response → resolve decision bead
    - Status updates: periodic project summaries → openclaw digest
    - Demo ready: MVP complete → openclaw notification with launch instructions

    ## Acceptance Criteria

    - [ ] CEO receives escalation notifications on their messaging device
    - [ ] CEO can approve/deny decisions from openclaw
    - [ ] Responses flow back to Loom and unblock dependent work
    - [ ] Integration is opt-in per project (config flag)
    - [ ] Works without openclaw (graceful degradation)
