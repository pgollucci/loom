title: "Milestone 1: Production Ready (v1.0) - Q1 2026"
description: |
  Make AgentiCorp production-ready with essential features for real-world deployment.
  
  Theme: Production readiness with streaming, security, and intelligent routing.
  
  Target Date: End of Q1 2026
  
  Goals:
  1. Streaming Support (bd-051) - Enable real-time response streaming
  2. Authentication & Authorization (bd-052) - Multi-user deployments with security
  3. Advanced Provider Routing (bd-053) - Cost and latency optimization
  
  Success Metrics:
  - Authentication: 100% of endpoints secured
  - Streaming: <500ms time to first byte
  - Routing: 30% cost reduction achieved
  - Security: Zero critical vulnerabilities
  
  Dependencies: None - this is the foundation milestone
  
  Release Criteria:
  - All P1 features complete and tested
  - Full QA sign-off on streaming functionality
  - Security audit passed for authentication
  - Performance benchmarks met (500ms first byte, <100ms routing decision)
  - Documentation updated for all new features
  - Migration guide for existing users
  
  Risk Factors:
  - Medium: Streaming implementation complexity across multiple providers
  - Low: Authentication integration with existing deployments
  - Medium: Provider routing algorithm optimization
