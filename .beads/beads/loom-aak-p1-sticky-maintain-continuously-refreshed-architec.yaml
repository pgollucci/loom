title: P1 (sticky) Maintain continuously refreshed architecture diagram
description: |
    This is a sticky, ongoing bead.

    Goal
    - Maintain an up-to-date architecture diagram that reflects the current
      Loom system.

    Trigger conditions (update is required when ANY occur)
    - A new service is added
    - A new agent type or core agent lifecycle feature is added
    - A new persona is added or persona responsibilities materially change
    - A new feature is added that is tracked as an EPIC bead (must update diagram)

    Requirements
    - Architecture diagram must be refreshed as necessary and remain accurate.
    - Diagram should reflect:
      - Services (API server, Temporal, DB/key manager, UI, etc.)
      - Major subsystems and data flow (beads, decisions, dispatch, event bus)
      - How personas/agents interact with beads and decisions
    - Store the diagram in a stable location under docs/ (e.g., docs/architecture/)
      and/or update ARCHITECTURE.md if that is the canonical home.

    Conventions
    - Prefer a text-based diagram that is easy to diff (Mermaid or ASCII) unless a
      rendered asset is required.
    - The diagram should include the date of last update.
