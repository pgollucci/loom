title: P0 - Project management UI must support full CRUD with API parity
description: |
  The project management UI currently lacks an Add Project button and should
  fully support create, read, update, and delete operations. All views should
  expose full CRUD in the UI and via the API.

  Requirements
  - Add UI affordances to create, edit, and delete projects.
  - Ensure API endpoints support full CRUD for projects.
  - All project views must surface CRUD actions consistently.

  Acceptance Criteria
  - Users can create, edit, and delete projects from the UI.
  - API supports the same CRUD operations with validation and persistence.
  - Project list and viewer stay in sync after CRUD actions.
