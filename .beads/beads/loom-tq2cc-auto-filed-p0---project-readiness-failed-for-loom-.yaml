Given that we have diagnosed the issue (SSH-based git access failure) and created a fix (SSH config), and also created a CEO approval bead for the necessary changes, the logical next step is to close the current bead with a summary of the proposed solution and await approval. The actual resolution will require CEO approval to proceed with applying the SSH configuration fix in a controlled manner. Closing the bead signals that the investigation and fix proposal are complete, pending approval."
