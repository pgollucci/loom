title: Implement intelligent response caching
description: |
  Build caching system that intelligently caches LLM responses based on
  request similarity.
  
  Tasks:
  - Design cache key generation
  - Implement exact match caching
  - Add semantic similarity caching
  - Create cache storage layer
  - Implement cache lookup logic
  
  Acceptance:
  - Exact match requests cached
  - Similar requests use cached responses
  - Cache hit reduces cost to zero
  - Cache responses return in <50ms
  - Cache key collision rate minimal
