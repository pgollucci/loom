title: '[CEO] Code Fix Approval: Infrastructure Setup for loom-self Project Readiness'
description: |-
    ## Code Fix Proposal

    **Original Bug:** loom-278e3

    ### Root Cause Analysis
    The project readiness check failed due to two infrastructure issues:
    1. Git remote access failed (exit status 128) due to SSH key verification issues
    2. Missing .beads directory at data/projects/loom-self/.beads

    ### Proposed Fix
    1. Create the necessary directory structure for loom-self project
    2. Create the .beads directory to satisfy project readiness requirements
    3. Ensure SSH key is properly configured for git access

    ### Changes Required
    The fix involves creating directories and setting up SSH configuration. No code changes are needed.

    ### Risk Assessment
    **Risk Level:** Low
    **Side Effects:** None - only directory creation and file updates
    **Testing:** Directory structure verification and git access test

    ### Recommendation
    I recommend approval because this is an infrastructure setup issue required for project readiness, not a code defect. The fix enables all future development on loom-self by establishing the required directory structure and SSH configuration.
