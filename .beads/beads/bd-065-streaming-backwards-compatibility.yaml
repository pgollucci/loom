title: Maintain backwards compatibility with non-streaming endpoints
description: |
  Ensure that existing non-streaming API endpoints continue to work and that
  clients can choose between streaming and non-streaming modes.
  
  CANCELLED: Not needed - codebase has not shipped any releases yet, no external 
  clients exist. Both streaming and non-streaming modes ship together from initial release.
  
  Tasks:
  - Keep existing non-streaming endpoints functional ✓ (implemented from start)
  - Add streaming flag/parameter to API ✓ (implemented from start)
  - Implement graceful fallback for unsupported providers ✓ (implemented from start)
  - Test both modes with all providers ✓ (implemented from start)
  - Document streaming vs non-streaming usage ✓ (implemented from start)
  
  Acceptance:
  - Existing API clients continue to work ✓ (N/A - no clients exist yet)
  - Streaming opt-in via query param or header ✓
  - Providers without streaming work normally ✓
  - Both modes tested and documented ✓
