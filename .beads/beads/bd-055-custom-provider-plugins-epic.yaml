title: Custom Provider Plugin System
description: |
  Create a plugin system to allow users to add support for custom AI providers
  without modifying AgentiCorp's source code.
  
  Problem: Users can't easily add new providers without modifying AgentiCorp's 
  source code, limiting flexibility.
  
  Goals:
  - Define provider plugin interface
  - Support loading plugins from external files
  - Provide plugin development guide and examples
  - Create plugin registry/marketplace concept
  - Support both HTTP and native (SDK-based) providers
  
  Success Criteria:
  - Users can add providers without code changes
  - Plugin API is well-documented
  - Example plugins exist for common providers
  - Plugins can handle streaming, auth, and errors
  - Plugin crashes don't crash AgentiCorp
  
  User Impact: Extends AgentiCorp to any LLM provider without waiting for official 
  support.
