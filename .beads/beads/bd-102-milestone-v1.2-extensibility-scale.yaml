title: "Milestone 3: Extensibility & Scale (v1.2) - Q3 2026"
description: |
  Enable community contributions and enterprise-scale deployments.
  
  Theme: Plugin system and high availability.
  
  Target Date: End of Q3 2026
  
  Goals:
  1. Custom Provider Plugin System (bd-055) - Extensibility for any provider
  2. Load Balancing & High Availability (bd-057) - Enterprise-scale deployment
  
  Success Metrics:
  - Plugins: 5+ community plugins created
  - Scale: 1000+ req/sec sustained
  - HA: 99.9% uptime achieved
  - Plugin API: 100% documented
  
  Dependencies:
  - Depends on Milestone 2 (bd-101) - Caching infrastructure for distributed deployments
  
  Release Criteria:
  - Plugin API documented and stable
  - At least 3 example plugins created
  - Multi-instance deployment tested
  - QA sign-off on HA functionality
  - Load testing passed (>1000 req/sec)
  - Distributed state consistency verified
  
  Risk Factors:
  - Medium: Plugin API design requires careful consideration
  - High: Distributed state management complexity
  - Medium: Load balancing with stateful connections (streaming)
