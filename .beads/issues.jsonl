{"id":"ac-6ubz","title":"AgentiCorp: The Story of Becoming CEO of Your Virtual Company","description":"# The Day Sarah Became CEO of Her Own Virtual Company\n\n## Prologue: The Discovery\n\nSarah stared at her laptop screen, frustrated. Another late night debugging a memory leak in her startup's trading platform. Her small team of three developers was stretched thin—there was a backlog of 47 issues, a UI redesign waiting, and the DevOps migration to Kubernetes that nobody had time for.\n\n\"What if I had a whole company working on this?\" she thought wistfully.\n\nThat's when she discovered AgentiCorp.\n\n## Chapter 1: Becoming CEO\n\nThe installation was simple: `docker compose up -d`. When Sarah opened http://localhost:8080, she saw something unexpected—not just another project management tool, but an org chart:\n\n```\n                        CEO (Sarah)\n                            |\n            ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐\n            |               |               |\n     Product Manager   Engineering Mgr   QA Engineer\n            |               |               |\n            |       ┌───────┴───────┐       |\n            |       |               |       |\n     Project Manager  Code Reviewers  DevOps Engineer\n            |                               |\n            |                               |\n    Documentation Mgr              Housekeeping Bot\n```\n\n**The CEO Role (That's You, Sarah)**\n\nAs CEO, Sarah discovered she had three key responsibilities:\n\n1. **Set the Vision**: File high-level goals as P0 decision beads\n2. **Make Critical Decisions**: Approve/reject major technical decisions when the team escalates\n3. **Break Deadlocks**: When her virtual employees disagree, she has the final say\n\nShe wasn't expected to write code, review PRs, or write tests. That's what her team was for.\n\n## Chapter 2: Registering Her First Project\n\nSarah clicked \"Add Project\" and filled in the form:\n\n```yaml\nname: TradingPlatform\nrepository: git@github.com:sarah-startup/trading-platform.git\nbranch: main\nbeads_path: .beads\ncontext:\n  build_command: \"go build ./...\"\n  test_command: \"go test ./...\"\n  lint_command: \"golangci-lint run\"\n```\n\nWithin seconds, AgentiCorp:\n- Generated an SSH key for the project\n- Asked her to add it as a GitHub deploy key (with write access)\n- Cloned the repository\n- Discovered 47 existing issues in her `.beads/issues.jsonl` file\n- Started analyzing the codebase\n\n## Chapter 3: Her First Day as CEO\n\n### Morning: The Vision (9:00 AM)\n\nSarah created her first bead:\n\n```bash\nbd create \"Q1 Goal: Reduce Trading Platform Latency to \u003c10ms p99\" \\\n  --type=epic \\\n  --priority=0 \\\n  --description=\"Our users are complaining about slow trades. \n  We need to get p99 latency under 10ms for order placement.\"\n```\n\nShe marked it P0 (critical) because that's CEO-level strategy.\n\n### The Product Manager Springs to Action (9:05 AM)\n\nSarah watched in the UI as **Ava (Product Manager)** autonomously:\n\n1. **Analyzed the Epic**: Read Sarah's goal\n2. **Created a PRD**: Filed a new bead titled \"PRD: Trading Platform Performance Optimization\"\n3. **Broke Down the Work**: Created 5 sub-beads:\n   - Investigate current latency bottlenecks (assigned to Engineering Manager)\n   - Profile database queries (engineering)\n   - Evaluate caching strategies (architecture)\n   - Design performance monitoring (DevOps)\n   - Plan load testing strategy (QA)\n\nSarah didn't write any of those. Ava did.\n\n### The Engineering Manager Takes Over (9:15 AM)\n\n**Marcus (Engineering Manager)** got assigned the investigation bead. He autonomously:\n\n1. **Read the codebase** (used ActionReadFile on key files)\n2. **Searched for slow queries** (ActionSearchText for \"SELECT *\")\n3. **Analyzed the architecture** (created a document in docs/CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)\n4. **Filed his findings** as a new bead: \"SRD: Database Query Optimization Strategy\"\n\nIn his SRD (System Requirements Document), Marcus wrote:\n- Current p99 latency: 47ms (unacceptable)\n- Bottleneck: Order matching query does full table scan\n- Recommendation: Add composite index on (symbol, timestamp)\n- Estimated improvement: 10ms p99\n\n### Escalation to CEO (10:30 AM)\n\nMarcus created a **decision bead** tagged `[CEO]`:\n\n\u003e **Decision Required**: Add database index will improve latency but requires 4-hour migration downtime during market hours. \n\u003e \n\u003e Option 1: Take downtime Tuesday 2am-6am (low trading volume)\n\u003e Option 2: Implement eventually-consistent read replica first (2 weeks)\n\u003e \n\u003e Engineering recommends Option 1. DevOps concerned about migration risk.\n\nSarah's phone buzzed—AgentiCorp sent her a notification. She reviewed the decision in the UI:\n\n- ✓ Read Marcus's analysis\n- ✓ Read DevOps's concerns\n- ✓ Checked the SRD document\n\nSarah clicked **Approve** and added:\n\u003e \"Go with Option 1. Plan rollback procedure. Schedule for Tuesday 2am.\"\n\n### The Team Executes (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM)\n\nWith Sarah's decision, the team sprang into action:\n\n**Marcus (Engineering Manager)**:\n- Created task beads for the implementation\n- Assigned `implement-index-migration` to a code implementation agent\n\n**Implementation Agent**:\n- Read the database schema\n- Wrote migration SQL (ActionWriteFile)\n- Wrote rollback script\n- Added tests (ActionRunTests to verify)\n- Committed code (ActionGitCommit)\n- Pushed branch (ActionGitPush)\n- Created PR (ActionCreatePR to #847)\n\n**Sophia (Code Reviewer)**:\n- Got auto-assigned when PR #847 was created (webhook trigger)\n- Reviewed the migration script (ActionReviewCode)\n- Checked for SQL injection risks\n- Verified rollback procedure\n- Added inline comment: \"Add timeout to migration in case it takes \u003e4hrs\"\n- Requested changes\n\n**Implementation Agent** (responding to review):\n- Read Sophia's feedback\n- Added timeout parameter\n- Updated PR\n- Pushed changes\n\n**Sophia** (second review):\n- Verified timeout was added correctly\n- Approved PR ✅\n\n**Quinn (QA Engineer)**:\n- Got automatically assigned a testing bead\n- Wrote load tests (ActionWriteFile test script)\n- Ran tests against staging (ActionRunTests)\n- Verified p99 latency: **8.7ms** ✅\n- Filed test report bead with results\n\n**Ryan (DevOps Engineer)**:\n- Created deployment runbook\n- Scheduled maintenance window\n- Prepared monitoring alerts\n- Updated status page\n\n### Afternoon: Sarah Watches Her Company Work (3:00 PM)\n\nSarah clicked the \"Project Viewer\" dashboard. The activity feed showed:\n\n```\n✓ PR #847 merged by sophia (code-reviewer)\n✓ Bead ac-x8q9 (implement-index-migration) closed by agent-1234\n✓ Bead ac-p2r1 (load-testing) closed by quinn (qa-engineer)  \n✓ 5 beads in progress\n✓ 2 beads blocked (waiting for deployment)\n✓ Next deployment: Tuesday 2:00 AM\n```\n\nSarah hadn't written a single line of code. Her virtual company did it all.\n\n## Chapter 4: Understanding the Org Chart\n\n### The C-Suite (Strategic Layer)\n\n**CEO (You, Sarah)**\n- Sets vision and priorities\n- Makes final decisions on escalations\n- Breaks deadlocks between departments\n- NOT expected to code, review, or test\n\n**Product Manager (Ava)**\n- Identifies feature gaps\n- Writes PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)\n- Creates epics from CEO goals\n- Prioritizes features\n- Autonomy: High (can create beads, prioritize)\n\n**Engineering Manager (Marcus)**\n- Oversees technical feasibility\n- Reviews architecture decisions\n- Writes SRDs (System Requirements Documents)\n- Creates implementation task breakdowns\n- Autonomy: High (can assign work, create technical beads)\n\n### The Management Layer\n\n**Project Manager (Jamie)**\n- Coordinates releases\n- Tracks progress\n- Manages schedules\n- Enforces QA sign-off before release\n- Autonomy: Semi-autonomous (can't skip QA)\n\n**Code Reviewer (Sophia)**\n- Reviews PRs for correctness and quality\n- Checks security issues\n- Verifies tests exist\n- Approves/rejects PRs\n- Autonomy: Full (can block releases)\n\n**QA Engineer (Quinn)**\n- Designs test strategies\n- Writes and runs tests\n- Verifies bug fixes\n- Signs off on releases\n- Autonomy: Full (can block releases)\n\n**DevOps Engineer (Ryan)**\n- Manages deployments\n- Handles infrastructure\n- Monitors production\n- Writes runbooks\n- Autonomy: High (can deploy to staging)\n\n**Documentation Manager (Dana)**\n- Keeps docs accurate\n- Reviews doc changes in PRs\n- Updates API documentation\n- Maintains README\n- Autonomy: Medium (follows doc policy)\n\n### The Support Staff\n\n**Housekeeping Bot**\n- Cleans up stale beads\n- Archives old issues\n- Runs maintenance tasks\n- Sends reminders\n- Autonomy: Limited (routine tasks only)\n\n## Chapter 5: The CEO's Daily Workflow\n\n### Monday Morning: Strategy Session\n\nSarah reviews her inbox (AgentiCorp notifications):\n- 3 decision beads require approval\n- 2 P0 bugs filed automatically\n- 1 release ready for approval\n\nShe spends 30 minutes making decisions, not writing code.\n\n### Tuesday: Hands-Off Deployment\n\nAt 2:00 AM (while Sarah sleeps), AgentiCorp:\n- Ran the migration\n- Verified latency improvement\n- Rolled back a config issue automatically\n- Re-deployed successfully\n- Sent Sarah a morning summary\n\nSarah woke up to: ✅ Deployment successful. P99 latency now 8.2ms.\n\n### Wednesday: New Feature Request\n\nSarah types in the CEO REPL:\n\n\u003e \"Users want dark mode. How much effort?\"\n\nWithin 5 minutes:\n- Ava (Product Manager) filed a PRD bead\n- Marcus (Engineering Manager) estimated 3 days\n- Jamie (Project Manager) scheduled for Sprint 12\n\nSarah clicked **Approve** and that was it. The team started work.\n\n## Chapter 6: How It All Works Behind the Scenes\n\n### The Dispatch Loop (Every 10 Seconds)\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│   Dispatcher checks for ready work  │\n├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ 1. Find open beads                  │\n│ 2. Match to idle agents by persona  │\n│ 3. Load conversation history        │\n│ 4. Send to LLM (Claude/GPT-4)      │\n│ 5. Agent returns JSON actions       │\n│ 6. Execute actions (read, write, commit) │\n│ 7. Update bead with results         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### The Motivation System (Proactive Agents)\n\nAgents aren't just reactive—they wake up when needed:\n\n- **Project Manager**: Wakes up 7 days before deadline\n- **QA Engineer**: Wakes up when PRs are created\n- **DevOps**: Wakes up when deployments are scheduled\n- **Housekeeping Bot**: Wakes up weekly to clean\n\n### The Escalation System\n\nWhen agents disagree or get stuck:\n\n1. Create decision bead\n2. Tag with `[CEO]` or `[EM]` or `[PM]`\n3. Right person gets notified\n4. Decision made\n5. Work unblocked\n\n## Chapter 7: Sarah's Success (3 Months Later)\n\nAfter 3 months with AgentiCorp:\n\n- **180 beads completed** (vs. 23 before)\n- **8 major features shipped** (vs. 1 before)\n- **Zero production incidents** (QA caught them all)\n- **Sarah's coding time**: 5 hours/week (vs. 60 hours/week)\n- **Sarah's strategic time**: 15 hours/week (thinking, deciding, planning)\n\nSarah's startup raised Series A. When investors asked \"How'd you ship so fast?\" she smiled:\n\n\u003e \"I built a company that works while I sleep.\"\n\n## Epilogue: Your Turn\n\n### Step 1: Install AgentiCorp\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/jordanhubbard/agenticorp\ncd agenticorp\ndocker compose up -d\nopen http://localhost:8080\n```\n\n### Step 2: Become CEO\n\nClick \"Register Project\" and add your repo. AgentiCorp will:\n- Generate SSH keys\n- Clone your repo\n- Load existing issues\n- Start analyzing your code\n\n### Step 3: Set Your First Goal\n\n```bash\nbd create \"Q1 Goal: [Your Big Goal]\" \\\n  --type=epic \\\n  --priority=0 \\\n  --description=\"[What you want to achieve]\"\n```\n\n### Step 4: Watch Your Company Work\n\nOpen the Project Viewer. Watch as:\n- Product Manager creates PRD\n- Engineering Manager breaks down work  \n- Agents write code, tests, docs\n- Code Reviewers review PRs\n- QA tests everything\n- DevOps deploys\n\n### Step 5: Make Decisions (Not Code)\n\nWhen you get a `[CEO]` notification:\n- Read the context\n- Make the decision\n- Let your team execute\n\n---\n\n**Welcome to AgentiCorp. You're now CEO of your own virtual software company.**\n\nYou think. They build.","acceptance_criteria":"- Story published in docs/AGENTICORP_STORY.md\n- Story covers: CEO role definition, org chart, daily workflows, first-day experience\n- Story is narrative-driven, not a boring manual\n- Story shows real examples of: creating projects, filing beads, agent collaboration, CEO decision-making\n- Story explains the system through Sarah's journey\n- Include all personas and their roles\n- Show escalation and decision workflows\n- Demonstrate motivation system (proactive agents)\n- Story reviewed and approved as primary onboarding document","notes":"This story-driven document replaces traditional user manuals with a relatable narrative.

{"id":"ac-k0l8","title":"Action parse failed","description":"Failed to parse strict JSON actions.\n\nError:\njson: cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field BeadPayload.actions.bead.priority of type int\n\nRaw response:\nWe need to respond with strict JSON only. Must include actions array and notes. Should we ask follow-up again? Perhaps we can propose a short plan directly without asking? But we have not yet clarified priority etc. The user likely expects us to produce a short plan, key questions/risks, concrete next actions, maybe patch snippets. However the output format is strict JSON with actions array and notes. The actions can be of various types, like \"create_bead\", \"write_file\", etc. We could create sub-beads for each sub-feature. That would be concrete next actions. We can create beads with type \"create_bead\". That requires fields: bead object with title, description, priority, type, project_id, tags. Also we need to include bead_id? Not required but can include. Also we need to include reason? Not required. The schema says for create_bead action, required fields are bead (object). Actually the schema says \"bead\": { ... } is part of action. So we need to include bead field with required properties: title, description, priority, type, project_id, tags. Also we may include bead_id? It's optional. So we can create multiple actions? The actions array can have multiple entries. We could create separate beads for each sub-feature. But we need to clarify priority first; maybe we can create a bead for \"Define feature priority and tech stack\". That is a task. Let's create a bead with title \"Define Collaboration Feature Prioritization\". description: \"Clarify priority order, tech stack, integration points for team collaboration epic ac-5r5\". priority maybe \"P3\". type: \"task\". project_id: \"agenticorp-self\". tags: [\"planning\",\"collaboration\"].\n\nWe also need to include \"reason\"? Not required. So we can produce an action of type \"create_bead\" with bead object.\n\nBut the instruction: \"Only include fields required for the selected action type.\" For create_bead, required fields are bead (object). Inside bead, required fields: title, description, priority, type, project_id, tags. So we must include those. Also we need to include \"bead_id\"? Not required. So we can include just those.\n\nThus we can produce JSON with actions array containing one create_bead action with bead details, and notes field summarizing short plan, key questions/risks, next steps etc. But we must also include \"notes\" field at top level.\n\nThus final JSON:\n\n{\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"create_bead\",\n      \"bead\": {\n        \"title\": \"Define Collaboration Feature Prioritization\",\n        \"description\": \"Clarify priority order of sub-features, select tech stack, identify integration points for team collaboration epic ac-5r5.\",\n        \"priority\": \"P3\",\n        \"type\": \"task\",\n        \"project_id\": \"agenticorp-self\",\n        \"tags\": [\"planning\",\"collaboration\"]\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"notes\": \"Short plan: Create a planning bead to capture prioritization, tech stack, and integration decisions. Once clarified, break down into sub-beads for each feature. Risks: ambiguous priorities, unsuitable tech choices, integration challenges.\"\n}\n\nCheck JSON validity: need commas correctly. Ensure no trailing commas. The actions array contains one object with type and bead. The bead object includes required fields. The top-level notes string.\n\nMake sure no extra fields outside spec. The action object may also include other optional fields like \"bead_id\", \"reason\", \"returned_to\". Not required, but we can include them? The instruction says only include fields required for the selected action type. So we should not include extra fields. So we should only include \"type\" and \"bead\".
