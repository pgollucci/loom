{"id":"ac-6ubz","title":"AgentiCorp: The Story of Becoming CEO of Your Virtual Company","description":"# The Day Sarah Became CEO of Her Own Virtual Company\n\n## Prologue: The Discovery\n\nSarah stared at her laptop screen, frustrated. Another late night debugging a memory leak in her startup's trading platform. Her small team of three developers was stretched thin—there was a backlog of 47 issues, a UI redesign waiting, and the DevOps migration to Kubernetes that nobody had time for.\n\n\"What if I had a whole company working on this?\" she thought wistfully.\n\nThat's when she discovered AgentiCorp.\n\n## Chapter 1: Becoming CEO\n\nThe installation was simple: `docker compose up -d`. When Sarah opened http://localhost:8080, she saw something unexpected—not just another project management tool, but an org chart:\n\n```\n                        CEO (Sarah)\n                            |\n            ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐\n            |               |               |\n     Product Manager   Engineering Mgr   QA Engineer\n            |               |               |\n            |       ┌───────┴───────┐       |\n            |       |               |       |\n     Project Manager  Code Reviewers  DevOps Engineer\n            |                               |\n            |                               |\n    Documentation Mgr              Housekeeping Bot\n```\n\n**The CEO Role (That's You, Sarah)**\n\nAs CEO, Sarah discovered she had three key responsibilities:\n\n1. **Set the Vision**: File high-level goals as P0 decision beads\n2. **Make Critical Decisions**: Approve/reject major technical decisions when the team escalates\n3. **Break Deadlocks**: When her virtual employees disagree, she has the final say\n\nShe wasn't expected to write code, review PRs, or write tests. That's what her team was for.\n\n## Chapter 2: Registering Her First Project\n\nSarah clicked \"Add Project\" and filled in the form:\n\n```yaml\nname: TradingPlatform\nrepository: git@github.com:sarah-startup/trading-platform.git\nbranch: main\nbeads_path: .beads\ncontext:\n  build_command: \"go build ./...\"\n  test_command: \"go test ./...\"\n  lint_command: \"golangci-lint run\"\n```\n\nWithin seconds, AgentiCorp:\n- Generated an SSH key for the project\n- Asked her to add it as a GitHub deploy key (with write access)\n- Cloned the repository\n- Discovered 47 existing issues in her `.beads/issues.jsonl` file\n- Started analyzing the codebase\n\n## Chapter 3: Her First Day as CEO\n\n### Morning: The Vision (9:00 AM)\n\nSarah created her first bead:\n\n```bash\nbd create \"Q1 Goal: Reduce Trading Platform Latency to \u003c10ms p99\" \\\n  --type=epic \\\n  --priority=0 \\\n  --description=\"Our users are complaining about slow trades. \n  We need to get p99 latency under 10ms for order placement.\"\n```\n\nShe marked it P0 (critical) because that's CEO-level strategy.\n\n### The Product Manager Springs to Action (9:05 AM)\n\nSarah watched in the UI as **Ava (Product Manager)** autonomously:\n\n1. **Analyzed the Epic**: Read Sarah's goal\n2. **Created a PRD**: Filed a new bead titled \"PRD: Trading Platform Performance Optimization\"\n3. **Broke Down the Work**: Created 5 sub-beads:\n   - Investigate current latency bottlenecks (assigned to Engineering Manager)\n   - Profile database queries (engineering)\n   - Evaluate caching strategies (architecture)\n   - Design performance monitoring (DevOps)\n   - Plan load testing strategy (QA)\n\nSarah didn't write any of those. Ava did.\n\n### The Engineering Manager Takes Over (9:15 AM)\n\n**Marcus (Engineering Manager)** got assigned the investigation bead. He autonomously:\n\n1. **Read the codebase** (used ActionReadFile on key files)\n2. **Searched for slow queries** (ActionSearchText for \"SELECT *\")\n3. **Analyzed the architecture** (created a document in docs/CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)\n4. **Filed his findings** as a new bead: \"SRD: Database Query Optimization Strategy\"\n\nIn his SRD (System Requirements Document), Marcus wrote:\n- Current p99 latency: 47ms (unacceptable)\n- Bottleneck: Order matching query does full table scan\n- Recommendation: Add composite index on (symbol, timestamp)\n- Estimated improvement: 10ms p99\n\n### Escalation to CEO (10:30 AM)\n\nMarcus created a **decision bead** tagged `[CEO]`:\n\n\u003e **Decision Required**: Add database index will improve latency but requires 4-hour migration downtime during market hours. \n\u003e \n\u003e Option 1: Take downtime Tuesday 2am-6am (low trading volume)\n\u003e Option 2: Implement eventually-consistent read replica first (2 weeks)\n\u003e \n\u003e Engineering recommends Option 1. DevOps concerned about migration risk.\n\nSarah's phone buzzed—AgentiCorp sent her a notification. She reviewed the decision in the UI:\n\n- ✓ Read Marcus's analysis\n- ✓ Read DevOps's concerns\n- ✓ Checked the SRD document\n\nSarah clicked **Approve** and added:\n\u003e \"Go with Option 1. Plan rollback procedure. Schedule for Tuesday 2am.\"\n\n### The Team Executes (11:00 AM - 2:00 PM)\n\nWith Sarah's decision, the team sprang into action:\n\n**Marcus (Engineering Manager)**:\n- Created task beads for the implementation\n- Assigned `implement-index-migration` to a code implementation agent\n\n**Implementation Agent**:\n- Read the database schema\n- Wrote migration SQL (ActionWriteFile)\n- Wrote rollback script\n- Added tests (ActionRunTests to verify)\n- Committed code (ActionGitCommit)\n- Pushed branch (ActionGitPush)\n- Created PR (ActionCreatePR to #847)\n\n**Sophia (Code Reviewer)**:\n- Got auto-assigned when PR #847 was created (webhook trigger)\n- Reviewed the migration script (ActionReviewCode)\n- Checked for SQL injection risks\n- Verified rollback procedure\n- Added inline comment: \"Add timeout to migration in case it takes \u003e4hrs\"\n- Requested changes\n\n**Implementation Agent** (responding to review):\n- Read Sophia's feedback\n- Added timeout parameter\n- Updated PR\n- Pushed changes\n\n**Sophia** (second review):\n- Verified timeout was added correctly\n- Approved PR ✅\n\n**Quinn (QA Engineer)**:\n- Got automatically assigned a testing bead\n- Wrote load tests (ActionWriteFile test script)\n- Ran tests against staging (ActionRunTests)\n- Verified p99 latency: **8.7ms** ✅\n- Filed test report bead with results\n\n**Ryan (DevOps Engineer)**:\n- Created deployment runbook\n- Scheduled maintenance window\n- Prepared monitoring alerts\n- Updated status page\n\n### Afternoon: Sarah Watches Her Company Work (3:00 PM)\n\nSarah clicked the \"Project Viewer\" dashboard. The activity feed showed:\n\n```\n✓ PR #847 merged by sophia (code-reviewer)\n✓ Bead ac-x8q9 (implement-index-migration) closed by agent-1234\n✓ Bead ac-p2r1 (load-testing) closed by quinn (qa-engineer)  \n✓ 5 beads in progress\n✓ 2 beads blocked (waiting for deployment)\n✓ Next deployment: Tuesday 2:00 AM\n```\n\nSarah hadn't written a single line of code. Her virtual company did it all.\n\n## Chapter 4: Understanding the Org Chart\n\n### The C-Suite (Strategic Layer)\n\n**CEO (You, Sarah)**\n- Sets vision and priorities\n- Makes final decisions on escalations\n- Breaks deadlocks between departments\n- NOT expected to code, review, or test\n\n**Product Manager (Ava)**\n- Identifies feature gaps\n- Writes PRDs (Product Requirements Documents)\n- Creates epics from CEO goals\n- Prioritizes features\n- Autonomy: High (can create beads, prioritize)\n\n**Engineering Manager (Marcus)**\n- Oversees technical feasibility\n- Reviews architecture decisions\n- Writes SRDs (System Requirements Documents)\n- Creates implementation task breakdowns\n- Autonomy: High (can assign work, create technical beads)\n\n### The Management Layer\n\n**Project Manager (Jamie)**\n- Coordinates releases\n- Tracks progress\n- Manages schedules\n- Enforces QA sign-off before release\n- Autonomy: Semi-autonomous (can't skip QA)\n\n**Code Reviewer (Sophia)**\n- Reviews PRs for correctness and quality\n- Checks security issues\n- Verifies tests exist\n- Approves/rejects PRs\n- Autonomy: Full (can block releases)\n\n**QA Engineer (Quinn)**\n- Designs test strategies\n- Writes and runs tests\n- Verifies bug fixes\n- Signs off on releases\n- Autonomy: Full (can block releases)\n\n**DevOps Engineer (Ryan)**\n- Manages deployments\n- Handles infrastructure\n- Monitors production\n- Writes runbooks\n- Autonomy: High (can deploy to staging)\n\n**Documentation Manager (Dana)**\n- Keeps docs accurate\n- Reviews doc changes in PRs\n- Updates API documentation\n- Maintains README\n- Autonomy: Medium (follows doc policy)\n\n### The Support Staff\n\n**Housekeeping Bot**\n- Cleans up stale beads\n- Archives old issues\n- Runs maintenance tasks\n- Sends reminders\n- Autonomy: Limited (routine tasks only)\n\n## Chapter 5: The CEO's Daily Workflow\n\n### Monday Morning: Strategy Session\n\nSarah reviews her inbox (AgentiCorp notifications):\n- 3 decision beads require approval\n- 2 P0 bugs filed automatically\n- 1 release ready for approval\n\nShe spends 30 minutes making decisions, not writing code.\n\n### Tuesday: Hands-Off Deployment\n\nAt 2:00 AM (while Sarah sleeps), AgentiCorp:\n- Ran the migration\n- Verified latency improvement\n- Rolled back a config issue automatically\n- Re-deployed successfully\n- Sent Sarah a morning summary\n\nSarah woke up to: ✅ Deployment successful. P99 latency now 8.2ms.\n\n### Wednesday: New Feature Request\n\nSarah types in the CEO REPL:\n\n\u003e \"Users want dark mode. How much effort?\"\n\nWithin 5 minutes:\n- Ava (Product Manager) filed a PRD bead\n- Marcus (Engineering Manager) estimated 3 days\n- Jamie (Project Manager) scheduled for Sprint 12\n\nSarah clicked **Approve** and that was it. The team started work.\n\n## Chapter 6: How It All Works Behind the Scenes\n\n### The Dispatch Loop (Every 10 Seconds)\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────┐\n│   Dispatcher checks for ready work  │\n├─────────────────────────────────────┤\n│ 1. Find open beads                  │\n│ 2. Match to idle agents by persona  │\n│ 3. Load conversation history        │\n│ 4. Send to LLM (Claude/GPT-4)      │\n│ 5. Agent returns JSON actions       │\n│ 6. Execute actions (read, write, commit) │\n│ 7. Update bead with results         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### The Motivation System (Proactive Agents)\n\nAgents aren't just reactive—they wake up when needed:\n\n- **Project Manager**: Wakes up 7 days before deadline\n- **QA Engineer**: Wakes up when PRs are created\n- **DevOps**: Wakes up when deployments are scheduled\n- **Housekeeping Bot**: Wakes up weekly to clean\n\n### The Escalation System\n\nWhen agents disagree or get stuck:\n\n1. Create decision bead\n2. Tag with `[CEO]` or `[EM]` or `[PM]`\n3. Right person gets notified\n4. Decision made\n5. Work unblocked\n\n## Chapter 7: Sarah's Success (3 Months Later)\n\nAfter 3 months with AgentiCorp:\n\n- **180 beads completed** (vs. 23 before)\n- **8 major features shipped** (vs. 1 before)\n- **Zero production incidents** (QA caught them all)\n- **Sarah's coding time**: 5 hours/week (vs. 60 hours/week)\n- **Sarah's strategic time**: 15 hours/week (thinking, deciding, planning)\n\nSarah's startup raised Series A. When investors asked \"How'd you ship so fast?\" she smiled:\n\n\u003e \"I built a company that works while I sleep.\"\n\n## Epilogue: Your Turn\n\n### Step 1: Install AgentiCorp\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/jordanhubbard/agenticorp\ncd agenticorp\ndocker compose up -d\nopen http://localhost:8080\n```\n\n### Step 2: Become CEO\n\nClick \"Register Project\" and add your repo. AgentiCorp will:\n- Generate SSH keys\n- Clone your repo\n- Load existing issues\n- Start analyzing your code\n\n### Step 3: Set Your First Goal\n\n```bash\nbd create \"Q1 Goal: [Your Big Goal]\" \\\n  --type=epic \\\n  --priority=0 \\\n  --description=\"[What you want to achieve]\"\n```\n\n### Step 4: Watch Your Company Work\n\nOpen the Project Viewer. Watch as:\n- Product Manager creates PRD\n- Engineering Manager breaks down work  \n- Agents write code, tests, docs\n- Code Reviewers review PRs\n- QA tests everything\n- DevOps deploys\n\n### Step 5: Make Decisions (Not Code)\n\nWhen you get a `[CEO]` notification:\n- Read the context\n- Make the decision\n- Let your team execute\n\n---\n\n**Welcome to AgentiCorp. You're now CEO of your own virtual software company.**\n\nYou think. They build.","acceptance_criteria":"- Story published in docs/AGENTICORP_STORY.md\n- Story covers: CEO role definition, org chart, daily workflows, first-day experience\n- Story is narrative-driven, not a boring manual\n- Story shows real examples of: creating projects, filing beads, agent collaboration, CEO decision-making\n- Story explains the system through Sarah's journey\n- Include all personas and their roles\n- Show escalation and decision workflows\n- Demonstrate motivation system (proactive agents)\n- Story reviewed and approved as primary onboarding document","notes":"This story-driven document replaces traditional user manuals with a relatable narrative.
