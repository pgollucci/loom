# Development Plan: Workflow System Implementation

*Generated on 2026-02-15 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [waterfall](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/waterfall)*

## Goal
Implement a comprehensive workflow system to enable multi-step agent workflows, role-based task assignment, and autonomous self-healing. This will unblock Loom's ability to fully fix its own bugs by defining who does what in multi-step processes (investigation → approval → fix → commit → verify).

## Requirements
<!-- beads-phase-id: loom-vhi7k -->

### Objectives
Define comprehensive requirements for the workflow system based on findings from SELF_HEALING_TEST_RESULTS.md.

### Tasks
*Tasks managed via `bd` CLI*

### Key Requirements to Define
- Workflow DAG structure (nodes, edges, transitions)
- Multi-dispatch support for long-running agent investigations
- Role-based assignment (Engineering Manager for commits, QA for verification)
- Retry and escalation logic
- CEO override capabilities
- Workflow state persistence
- Concurrent workflow execution

### Tasks
*Tasks managed via `bd` CLI*

### Integration Test Scenarios
1. Simple linear workflow (Start → Task → End)
2. Multi-step investigation with auto-redispatch
3. Approval workflow (Agent → CEO → Apply)
4. Retry on failure
5. Escalation to CEO after max retries
6. Concurrent workflows without conflicts
7. Role-based assignment (Engineering Manager commits)

## System Testing
<!-- beads-phase-id: TBD -->

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Integration tests are passing
- [ ] End-to-end workflows execute successfully
- [ ] Multi-dispatch works correctly
- [ ] Role assignment works correctly
- [ ] Retry/escalation logic works
- [ ] No critical bugs found in integration testing

### Objectives
Test complete self-healing loop from bug detection through fix verification.

### Tasks
*Tasks managed via `bd` CLI*

### System Test Scenarios
From SELF_HEALING_TEST_RESULTS.md:
1. **Investigation Continuation**: Agent gets multiple dispatch cycles
2. **Full Self-Healing Loop**: Bug → Investigate → Approve → Fix/Commit → Verify → Close
3. **Failure Handling**: Agent attempts fix 3 times → Escalate to CEO
4. **Concurrent Bugs**: 5 bugs simultaneously without conflicts

---

## Deployment
<!-- beads-phase-id: TBD -->

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] System tests pass
- [ ] Full self-healing loop works end-to-end
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] No critical bugs found
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Migration path is defined

### Objectives
Deploy workflow system to enable autonomous self-healing.

### Tasks
*Tasks managed via `bd` CLI*

### Deployment Steps
1. Run database migrations
2. Deploy updated loom binary
3. Configure default workflows (auto-bug workflow)
4. Enable auto-redispatch in dispatcher
5. Monitor initial workflow executions
6. Measure self-healing metrics

---

## Key Decisions
*Important decisions will be documented here as they are made*

### Requirements Phase (2026-02-15):
- **Workflow Type**: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for deterministic execution
- **Database**: SQLite with 3 tables (workflows, workflow_executions, workflow_transitions)
- **Node Types**: task, approval, decision, merge
- **Roles**: engineering-manager, qa-engineer, web-designer, backend-engineer, project-manager, ceo
- **Multi-Dispatch**: `redispatch_requested` flag in bead context enables multi-turn work
- **Commit Safety**: Serialize commit operations with queue and lock mechanism
- **Max Attempts**: Default 3 retries per node before escalation
- **Escalation**: Auto-create CEO approval bead when max attempts exceeded

### From SELF_HEALING_TEST_RESULTS.md:
- **Beads to Implement**: ac-1450 through ac-1455
- **Priority**: P0 - Blocks all self-healing functionality
- **Critical Path**: Engineering Manager must handle commits/pushes
- **Safety**: Single commit node per workflow to prevent conflicts

### Design Phase Discovery (2026-02-15):
**MAJOR DISCOVERY**: Workflow system infrastructure is **100% COMPLETE** (Phases 1-5, implemented 2026-01-27)

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Database schema (5 tables) with migrations
- ✅ Workflow engine (`internal/workflow/engine.go`, 16KB) with full state machine
- ✅ Dispatcher integration (`internal/dispatch/dispatcher.go:460-831`)
- ✅ Default workflows (bug.yaml, feature.yaml, ui.yaml, self-improvement.yaml)
- ✅ YAML loader (`internal/workflow/loader.go`)
- ✅ Database access layer (`internal/database/workflows.go`)
- ✅ Cycle detection (escalates after 3 cycles)
- ✅ Max attempts enforcement (default 3 per node)
- ✅ CEO escalation with auto-created decision beads
- ✅ Role-based routing (QA, Engineering Manager, Product Manager)
- ✅ REST API + visualization UI (Phase 4)
- ✅ Real-time monitoring + analytics (Phase 5)

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- ⚠️ **Gap #1**: Multi-dispatch `redispatch_requested` flag NOT implemented (blocks investigation continuation)
- ⚠️ **Gap #2**: Commit serialization NOT verified (potential concurrent git conflicts)
- ⚠️ **Gap #3**: Agent role assignment incomplete (falls back to persona matching)

**Task Scope Change:**
- **Original Plan**: Implement workflow system from scratch
- **Actual Task**: Close 2-3 integration gaps in existing system (est. 5-8 hours) + comprehensive testing (est. 4-6 hours)
- **Total**: ~9-14 hours to achieve full autonomous self-healing

## Notes
*Additional context and observations*

### Current State (from SELF_HEALING_TEST_RESULTS.md):
- Auto-filing: ✅ Working
- Auto-routing: ✅ Working
- Auto-dispatch: ✅ Working
- Agent investigation start: ✅ Working
- Multi-step investigation: ❌ Blocked (agents get 1 turn then stop)
- Fix application: ❌ Blocked (no defined commit/push role)
- Verification: ❌ Blocked (no workflow for testing)

### Architecture References:
- Workflow DAG structures needed
- State machine for transitions
- Database schema for persistence
- Integration with `internal/dispatch/dispatcher.go`
- Extension of bead context for workflow state

*This plan is maintained by the LLM and uses beads CLI for task management. Tool responses provide guidance on which bd commands to use for task management.*
