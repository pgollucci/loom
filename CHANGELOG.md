### Other

## [0.1.10] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- `public-relations-manager` added to `allowed_roles` in `config.yaml` — enables automatic creation of PR manager agents for all projects (loom, aviation, tokenhub) on startup; agents now monitor GitHub issues, PRs, and community interactions via the motivation system
- Filed beads for all open GitHub issues and PRs across loom (PRs #23, #24, #25), tokenhub (issues #3, #4, #7 and PRs #5, #6, #8, #9), and Aviation (issues #109, #110 and 23 Dependabot PRs)

### Changed
- `internal/dispatch/dispatcher.go`: `rolesMatch(a, b string) bool` helper added to normalize role name comparisons, replacing repeated inline `normalizeRoleName()` calls in `dispatch_phases.go`

### Fixed
- `make clean` now removes `site/` MkDocs build artifact directory

## [0.1.9] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- `loomctl bead errors <id>` — decodes and displays a bead's `error_history` in a readable per-dispatch table with timestamps and truncated error messages; also shows `dispatch_count`, `last_run_error`, `ralph_blocked_reason`, and `loop_detected_reason`
- `loomctl bead unblock <id>` — shorthand for redispatching a blocked bead with an optional `--reason` flag
- `loomctl provider list/show/register/delete` — provider management commands restored to source (existed in installed binary but had been lost from `main.go`, meaning any rebuild would silently drop them)
- `tokenhubctl model-test <id> [api-key]` — fires a real inference request through a specific model and reports status code, latency, token usage, and partial response; accepts key via argument, `TOKENHUB_API_KEY` env, or falls back to the admin token
- `tokenhubctl provider-status <id>` — shows full health detail for a single provider: state, request/error counts, average latency, last success time, last error message and timestamp, and cooldown expiry

### Fixed
- `tokenhubctl health` was displaying `-` for the ERRORS and LAST SUCCESS columns due to wrong field names (`consecutive_errors` / `last_success` instead of the API's actual `consec_errors` / `last_success_at`); columns now show correct values and a new LAST ERROR column has been added
- NATS consumer leak on restart: `Close()` now calls `conn.Drain()` with a 5-second deadline instead of iterating `Unsubscribe()`, cleanly unbinding durable consumers before the TCP connection drops and preventing "already bound" errors on the next startup
- NATS "already bound" recovery: `subscribe()` now detects the `already bound` error, deletes the stale durable consumer from the previous run, and retries once, preventing cascading context-canceled failures when the PDA orchestrator starts up
- `dispatch_phases.go`: `isProviderError` call-sites corrected after upstream signature changed from `error` to `string` — previously `isProviderError(execErr)` and `isProviderError(fmt.Errorf(...))` caused compile errors
- TaskExecutor `executeBead` return value: added missing `return false` on the success path after signature changed to `(needsBackoff bool)`
- Worker backoff: TaskExecutor workers now pause 3 seconds after a provider error instead of immediately retrying, preventing the 50+ RPS spin that saturated tokenhub's 60 RPS/IP rate limit

### Changed
- Ralph `LoomHeartbeatActivity` Phase 3 (DispatchOnce loop) is now a no-op: it was spawning goroutines tied to the Temporal activity context, causing all inflight tasks to receive `context.Canceled` every ~10 seconds when the activity completed (~1 300 errors/hour); TaskExecutor handles all execution directly
- Ralph auto-recovery now includes `rate limit` in the set of transient block reasons eligible for 30-minute cooldown reset
- Ralph auto-recovery for auth-blocked beads: beads blocked for authentication errors are now eligible for automatic reset after 2 hours (key rotation and temporary outages can cause auth failures that clear on their own)
- CEO REPL: agent dropdown added for targeted bead dispatch to a specific agent

## [0.1.8] - 2026-02-23

### Changed
- GitHub Pages now built with MkDocs (Material theme) instead of a bespoke Python script that referenced the long-deleted `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`; Pages deployment re-enabled via GitHub Actions
- Build gate: exit 127 (toolchain not found) now **blocks** commits instead of silently allowing them through; agent receives step-by-step instructions to detect and install the required toolchain then verify the build before retrying
- Build gate: build failure message now explicitly says "DO NOT call done or git_commit until the build passes" and provides the full compiler/tool output — prevents agents from giving up without fixing the error

### Fixed
- `docs/archive/` broken links no longer cause `mkdocs build` warnings (excluded via `exclude_docs`)
- `pymdownx` removed from Pages workflow pip install (it ships inside `mkdocs-material`, not as a standalone package)

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Executor idle/sleep mode: worker goroutines exit after 3 minutes of no work (36 × 5s idle rounds) instead of spinning forever, eliminating idle token spend
- Per-project watcher goroutine (long-lived): polls for ready beads every 30 seconds and respawns workers immediately when work appears
- Periodic git fetch in watcher: every 5 minutes, fetches the project's beads-sync branch and reloads if new commits are found — detects beads pushed externally without needing an API call
- `WakeProject(projectID)` on the executor and `Loom`: signals via buffered channel for zero-latency wake on bead creation or beads reset

### Changed
- `POST /api/v1/beads` (bead creation) now calls `WakeProject` after creating a bead, ensuring sleeping workers restart within milliseconds
- `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/beads/reset` also calls `WakeProject` after reload

### Fixed
- Agent-introduced build errors: `sync.Map` used as `map[string]int` for `actionHashes` and `actionTypeCount`, `handleTokenLimits` called with extra argument, `if` block body left orphaned in `handlers_analytics.go`

## [0.1.6] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Project beads reset API: `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/beads/reset` clears in-memory bead state and reloads from the beads-sync branch — essential for recovering from dolt migrations, force-pushed beads worktrees, or other out-of-band changes
- `loomctl project reset-beads <project-id>` subcommand to invoke the reset from the CLI
- `loomctl container` subcommands: `list`, `logs`, `restart`, `status` for managing project containers
- `loomctl bead list` now supports `--status`, `--type`, `--assigned-to`, and `--priority` filters

### Changed
- Replaced Temporal/NATS dispatch loop with direct `TaskExecutor` — worker goroutines now claim and run beads without going through Temporal workflows or NATS routing, eliminating the primary source of dispatch failures
- Bead status persistence hardened: closing a bead now always clears `assigned_to`; stale `open+assigned` beads are auto-reset on next claim attempt

### Fixed
- Beads completing work but remaining `open` due to `assigned_to` not being cleared on status update
- Dispatch starvation: skip open beads whose assigned agent is busy rather than blocking the entire queue
- Agent-introduced build errors repaired: duplicate const blocks, `sync.Map` used as regular map, `Priority *int` type mismatch, orphaned error-handling statements, missing braces, undefined sentinel errors

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Self-audit runner: periodically runs build/test/lint and files beads for failures (`SELF_AUDIT_INTERVAL_MINUTES`)
- Auto-merge runner: squash-merges approved agent PRs (`AUTO_MERGE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`)
- Sentinel errors `ErrBeadNotFound`, `ErrBeadAlreadyClaimed`, `ErrFileLocked` for structured error handling
- `SetUseNATSDispatch()` method on Dispatcher for per-instance NATS routing control

### Fixed
- Dispatcher task goroutine leaked on context cancellation (used `context.Background()` instead of request ctx)
- Commit lock held indefinitely when context cancelled mid-acquisition in `acquireCommitLock`
- Redispatch/escalate API endpoints silently ignored malformed JSON request bodies (now return 400)
- `os.WriteFile` debug calls in dispatch hot path silently swallowed errors and wrote to `/tmp`
- JSON unmarshal errors in loop detector `getErrorHistory`/`hasRecentProgress` silently returned empty values
- Error classification in bead API handlers used fragile `strings.Contains` matching (now uses `errors.Is`)
- `UseNATSDispatch` package-level global prevented test isolation (moved to struct field)
- NATS JetStream "consumer already bound" error resolved by scoping `ConsumerPrefix` to `ServiceID`
- Dispatch pipeline: stale beads reassigned, terminal beads skipped, remediation cascade capped (15-min cooldown, max 3 per bead, CEO escalation on exhaustion)
- Project initialization duplicated `loom` project entry on restart
