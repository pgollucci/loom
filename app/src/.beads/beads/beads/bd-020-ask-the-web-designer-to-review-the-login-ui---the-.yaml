title: Ask the web designer to review the login UI - the username field is large and the password field is small - it looks strange
description: |-
    Login form has inconsistent field sizing:
    - Username field: Large/prominent
    - Password field: Small/narrow

    This creates visual imbalance and looks unprofessional. Please review and recommend proper sizing for both fields to create a consistent, polished login experience.

    agent_output: "We need to output in specified format: 1) Short plan 2) Key questions/risks 3) Concrete next actions (commands/files) 4) Proposed patch snippets if applicable.\n\nWe are to work on bead bd-020: ask web designer to review login UI - inconsistency in field sizing. Provide plan etc.\n\nWe should likely create a decision bead? But the instruction: \"Work on bead bd-020: Ask the web designer to review the login UI - the username field is large and the password field is small - it looks strange\". So we need to produce output as per format: short plan, key questions/risks, concrete next actions, proposed patch snippets if applicable.\n\nProbably we need to suggest next steps: locate login UI file, examine CSS, propose adjustments, maybe create a decision bead? Since we need to ask designer to review, maybe we need to create a decision bead or request review. But output format is fixed.\n\nThus produce:\n\n1) Short plan: Investigate login UI, examine CSS, propose consistent sizing, possibly adjust width, padding, etc., get designer review.\n\n2) Key questions/risks: What is desired width? Accessibility? Mobile responsiveness? Branding? Potential impact on forms.\n\n3) Concrete next actions: open login.html or .vue, check CSS, modify width, add comment, run build, test.\n\n4) Proposed patch snippets: show CSS modifications.\n\nWe'll follow format exactly.\n\nMake sure to include bullet points etc.\n\nLet's craft.\n</think>\n**1) Short plan**  \n- Locate the login component (HTML/CSS/JS) in the repository.  \n- Examine current sizing (width, padding, font‑size) of the username and password inputs.  \n- Propose a unified sizing strategy (e.g., same `width` or `flex` basis) that feels balanced and matches the design system.  \n- Apply the minimal CSS change, run the local dev server, and verify the fix on desktop & mobile.  \n- Notify the web designer for a quick review of the updated markup and visual mock‑up.  \n\n**2) Key questions / risks**  \n- What is the intended design spec for the login form (e.g., exact pixel widths, percentage‑based layout, design‑system tokens)?  \n- Should the fields be full‑width, fixed‑width, or fluid with a max‑width?  \n- Does the current layout use a CSS framework that enforces sizing (e.g., utility classes, Tailwind, Bootstrap)?  \n- Will changing the sizing affect other forms or global input styles?  \n- Are there accessibility concerns (e.g., larger touch targets, contrast) that need to be addressed simultaneously?  \n\n**3) Concrete next actions**  \n- `cd ui/login` (or project root) → locate the login view file (e.g., `login.html`, `Login.vue`, `Login.jsx`).  \n- Open the associated stylesheet (`login.css`, `styles.css`, or scoped `<style>` block).  \n- Identify the CSS rules for `.username-input` and `.password-input` (or equivalent selectors).  \n- Propose a patch that makes both inputs share the same sizing (e.g., `width: 100%; max-width: 320px; padding: 0.75rem;`).  \n- Apply the patch locally, run `npm run dev` / `go run ./cmd/web` (or equivalent) to preview.  \n- Test on the login page in Chrome/Firefox dev tools, confirming the fields now align visually.  \n- Commit the change with a descriptive message (e.g., “fix: align sizing of username/password fields in login form”).  \n- Tag the change for designer review (e.g., push a branch `bd-020-fix-field-sizing` and comment on the design ticket).  \n\n**4) Proposed patch snippets**  \n\n```css\n/* Before */\n.username-input {\n  width: 90%;               /* large */\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n.password-input {\n  width: 40%;               /* small */\n  padding: 0.5rem;\n}\n\n/* After – unified sizing */\n.username-input,\n.password-input {\n  width: 100%;               /* full width of container */\n  max-width: 340px;          /* optional max width for larger screens */\n  padding: 0.75rem 1rem;\n  font-size: 1rem;\n  border: 1px solid var(--border-color);\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  transition: border-color 0.2s;\n}\n```\n\n*If the project uses a design token for input width, replace the hard‑coded values with the token (e.g., `var(--input-width)`).*  \n\n---  \n\n*Next step:* create a decision bead `bd-020-review` linking to the mock‑up preview and request the web designer’s sign‑off."
