    Failed to parse strict JSON actions.

    Error:
    invalid character 'W' looking for beginning of value

    Raw response:
    We need to follow output format: JSON only. Must include actions array with appropriate type etc. We are to work on bead bd-063: QA verification for bd-055. Need to verify header text shows "Agent Orchestration Platform" in UI. Likely need to inspect UI code, maybe frontend? This is Go project? Might be some web UI. Could be in templates or static files. Let's search for header text.

    Plan: read repository, search for header text, locate file, verify. Might need to read code to find where header displayed. Then maybe run tests? Since it's UI verification, maybe need to check compiled UI? Could be checking HTML template.

    We need to produce JSON with actions. Likely we need to read files to locate header. Use read_file or search_text. Then maybe create bead? But we are already working on bead bd-063. So we need to perform QA verification: maybe check that header text appears.

    Thus actions could be: read_file of relevant template, search_text for "Agent Orchestration Platform". Then maybe run command to build and test? test_command is go test ./... but that's for backend. UI verification maybe not covered. Could just read file and confirm.

    We need to output JSON with actions list. Probably one action: read_file of some path like "frontend/templates/header.html". But we don't know path. We can search_text across repo for that phrase.

    Use search_text action with query "Agent Orchestration Platform". Then based on results, maybe read file.

    We need to output only JSON. Provide fields: actions with type, question, path, query etc.

    Probably type: search_text, query: "Agent Orchestration Platform". Then after getting results, we could read file.

    But we need to output a single JSON with actions array. Could include multiple actions sequentially? Each action object can have type and other fields. Could include multiple objects in actions array.

    We need to decide next step: search for phrase.

    Thus action: type: search_text, query: "Agent Orchestration Platform". Provide maybe max_depth etc.

    Let's craft JSON:

    {
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "search_text",
          "query": "Agent Orchestration Platform",
          "path": ".",
          "limit": 100
        }
      ],
      "notes": "Search for the header text to locate the UI file containing it."
    }

    But need to include required fields for search_text: type, question?, path?, query?, max_depth?, limit?. The spec says only include fields required for selected action type. For search_text, required fields likely: type, query, path? Not sure. The example shows fields: type, question, path, patch, query, max_depth, limit, command, working_dir, bead, bead_id, reason, returned_to. But those are generic. Probably we need to include at least type and query? And path maybe optional. Let's include type, query, path.

    We'll output JSON only.
