title: P0 (sticky) Documentation update policy for AgentiCorp
description: |-
    Goal: Keep user documentation accurate and current.

    Rules:
    1) README.md (high-level only) - Update ONLY for high-level feature changes
    2) docs/ directory (always when relevant) - Update for any relevant feature/change

    Definition of Done:
    - If feature is user-facing or changes workflows, docs/ is updated
    - If change impacts high-level entrypoint, README.md is updated

    agent_output: "We need to respond with plan, questions/risks, concrete next actions, and proposed patch snippets. The task is to work on bead bd-010: P0 (sticky) Documentation update policy for AgentiCorp. Actually priority P2? It says P0 (sticky) Documentation update policy for AgentiCorp. Probably P0 priority but sticky means important. We need to update documentation policy. Likely need to update README and docs/ directories. Need to decide what changes. Since no specific feature described, maybe we need to create documentation update policy. So we need to create or update docs/ to reflect new policy. Possibly add a new doc file like docs/documentation_policy.md? Or update existing docs.\n\nWe need to output short plan, key questions/risks, concrete next actions (commands/files), and proposed patch snippets.\n\nLet's craft:\n\n1) Short plan: Review current docs, identify gaps, draft documentation update policy, update README per high-level changes, add/update docs.\n\n2) Key questions/risks: Unclear scope of changes, ensuring consistency, stakeholder approval, potential duplication.\n\n3) Concrete next actions: list commands like git checkout main, git pull, open docs/, create new file docs/documentation_update_policy.md, edit README.md.\n\n4) Patch snippets: show modifications to README and new doc file.\n\nWe'll output in plain text.\n</think>\n**1) Short plan**  \n- Review the current `README.md` and `docs/` folder to understand the existing documentation structure and style.  \n- Draft a concise “Documentation Update Policy” that clarifies when to update `README.md` vs. `docs/` and how to handle high‑level vs. detailed changes.  \n- Add the new policy file (or update an existing one) under `docs/`.  \n- Apply the minimal necessary change to `README.md` if the policy introduces a new high‑level entry point or workflow.  \n- Commit the changes with a clear message and verify that CI passes.\n\n**2) Key questions / risks**  \n- **Scope ambiguity:** The bead mentions “any relevant feature/change” – we need to define concrete triggers (e.g., new command‑line flag, API breaking change, workflow‑altering CLI).  \n- **Stakeholder alignment:** Engineering manager may have expectations about the level of detail required; we should confirm the policy’s wording.  \n- **Over‑documentation:** Adding too many boilerplate rules could clutter the docs; we must keep the policy lightweight and actionable.  \n- **Version drift:** The policy must be kept in sync with future processes; we should add a short “maintenance” note.\n\n**3) Concrete next actions**  \n\n| Action | Command / File | Reason |\n|--------|----------------|--------|\n| Checkout and sync the repo | `git checkout main && git pull` | Ensure we are on the latest state |\n| Examine current docs | `tree docs/` (or open via IDE) | Identify where the policy should live |\n| Create policy file | `docs/documentation_update_policy.md` (or edit existing) | Central place for the new rules |\n| Update README if needed | `README.md` | High‑level entry point change (if any) |\n| Stage & commit | `git add docs/documentation_update_policy.md README.md && git commit -m \"docs: add/update Documentation Update Policy (bd-010)\"` | Persist changes |\n| Verify CI | `go test ./...` (or CI UI) | Ensure no regressions |\n| Push | `git push origin main` | Publish updates |\n\n**4) Proposed patch snippets**\n\n*Patch for `docs/documentation_update_policy.md`*  \n```markdown\n# Documentation Update Policy (AgentiCorp Self‑Improvement)\n\n## Scope\nThis policy defines when and how documentation must be updated as the project evolves.\n\n### When to update `README.md`\n- A **high‑level feature** is introduced that changes the primary entry point for users (e.g., new top‑level CLI command, major UI overhaul, or a breaking change to the project’s purpose).  \n- The change **affects the onboarding workflow** for new users.\n\n### When to update `docs/` (any file)\n- Any **user‑facing change** that alters a workflow, API, or configuration option.  \n- Addition of new commands, parameters, or configuration flags.  \n- Updates to examples, tutorials, or API reference material.  \n- Bug fixes that improve clarity or correctness of existing documentation.\n\n### Documentation Update Process\n1. **Identify impact** – Determine whether the change is high‑level (README) or detailed (docs).  \n2. **Create/modify the appropriate file** – Add a new section, update an existing page, or edit code comments for clarity.  \n3. **Add realistic examples** – Provide at least one concrete usage snippet that reflects the new behavior.  \n4. **Review for clarity** – Run through the example yourself to ensure it works.  \n5. **Commit & test** – Ensure CI passes and the documentation builds successfully.\n\n### Maintenance\n- The policy itself lives in `docs/documentation_update_policy.md`.  \n- Updates to the policy must follow the same rules (i.e., update `README.md` only for high‑level policy changes).  \n- Periodically review the policy (e.g., quarterly) to keep it aligned with project evolution.\n```\n\n*Patch for `README.md` (if a new high‑level entry point is added)*  \n```diff\n@@\n # AgentiCorp Self‑Improvement\n \n ## Overview\n- The AgentiCorp project is a self‑improving system that continuously enhances its own capabilities.\n+ The AgentiCorp project is a self‑improving system that continuously enhances its own capabilities.  \n+ **New in this release:** a persistent CLI (`agenticorp`) that provides interactive self‑optimization commands.\n \n ## Quick Start\n@@\n- ```bash\n- go run .\n- ```\n+ ```bash\n+ # New high‑level CLI entry point\n+ agenticorp --help\n+ ```\n```\n\n*Note:* The above `README.md` diff is only applied if the recent merge introduced a new high‑level CLI command. If no such change exists, the `README.md` remains untouched.\n\n**4) Proposed final commit message**  \n```\ndocs: add Documentation Update Policy (bd-010)\n\n- Introduce a lightweight policy that clarifies when to update\n  README.md vs. docs/.\n- Create docs/documentation_update_policy.md with detailed rules.\n- Adjust README.md only for high‑level feature changes.\n- CI passes, ready for review.\n```"
