description: |-
    CONFIRMED: Backend has data but UI shows nothing

    Backend Status (Verified):
    - Database exists and is persisted: /app/data/agenticorp.db (114KB)
    - API is responding on port 8080
    - Projects: 2 registered
    - Beads: 5 open beads loaded (bd-013, bd-019, bd-021, bd-014, bd-009)
    - Agents: 10 default agents created
    - Providers: At least 1 provider (mock-local)

    Observed Frontend Problem:
    - Project dropdown shows "--" placeholder only
    - All bead columns (Open, In Progress, Closed) are completely empty
    - Agent assignments section is blank
    - No data is rendering at all

    This is a FRONTEND RENDERING ISSUE:
    1. JavaScript may not be fetching data from API
    2. JavaScript may be failing to render received data
    3. Console errors preventing execution
    4. CSS hiding all content
    5. Authentication token issues
    6. CORS blocking API calls
    7. Incorrect API endpoint URLs

    Debugging Actions Required:
    1. Open browser DevTools Console - check for JavaScript errors
    2. Open DevTools Network tab - verify API calls are being made
    3. Check if GET /api/v1/projects returns data
    4. Check if GET /api/v1/beads returns data
    5. Inspect HTML - see if data is present but hidden
    6. Review web/static/app.js for data fetching logic
    7. Check if localStorage has valid auth token

    Expected Fix:
    - Identify why frontend is not fetching or rendering backend data
    - Provide code patch to fix the rendering issue
