    agent_output: "We need to follow the process: create bead plan, then claim, then execute. The user gave a bead definition bd-015: UX review. We need to produce a short plan, key questions/risks, concrete next actions, and proposed patch snippets if applicable, in the specified output format. Then claim and execute.\n\nWe should output in the required format: 1) Short plan, 2) Key questions/risks, 3) Concrete next actions, 4) Proposed patch snippets if applicable.\n\nWe need to be careful to not claim prematurely? The process: create bead plan, then CLAIM_BEAD, wait, then EXECUTE_BEAD. But we are to output the plan first? Probably we need to output the plan, then claim, then execute. The instructions say \"When you encounter a decision point: 1. Is documentation needed? ... Example: ... # New feature merged → REVIEW changes → IDENTIFY documentation needs → UPDATE relevant docs immediately\". So now we have a bead to do UX review. We need to create a plan.\n\nThus we output something like:\n\n1) Short plan: Review files, assess UX, write findings to docs/UX_REVIEW.md, list recommendations.\n\n2) Key questions/risks: Are there accessibility issues? Is navigation confusing? etc.\n\n3) Concrete next actions: use cat/command to view files, maybe use grep, create docs/UX_REVIEW.md, edit it, etc.\n\n4) Proposed patch snippets: maybe suggestions for CSS changes.\n\nThen we claim the bead: CLAIM_BEAD bd-015\n\nWait for confirmation, then EXECUTE_BEAD bd-015\n\nWe need to produce the output in the specified format. Probably just the plan part now. Then we claim.\n\nThus respond with the plan, then claim. Probably we need to output the plan and then issue the CLAIM_BEAD command. The system likely expects us to output the plan, then claim. Let's do that.\n\nWe'll output:\n\n**1) Short plan**: ...\n\n**2) Key questions/risks**: ...\n\n**3) Concrete next actions**: ...\n\n**4) Proposed patch snippets**: ...\n\nThen issue CLAIM_BEAD bd-015.\n\nWe'll wait for confirmation before executing. So after claiming, we wait.\n\nThus final answer: Provide plan and claim.\n</think>\n**1) Short plan**  \n- Load and inspect the four web UI files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, `persona-editor.html`).  \n- Assess UX dimensions: usability, visual design, accessibility, responsiveness, IA, navigation.  \n- Summarize findings in `docs/UX_REVIEW.md`.  \n- Add a prioritized list of improvement recommendations (e.g., accessibility fixes, UI tweaks).  \n- If any concrete code/style changes are identified, draft small patch snippets to illustrate the fix.\n\n**2) Key questions / risks**  \n- Are ARIA labels and keyboard navigation fully implemented for all interactive elements?  \n- Does the layout adapt gracefully to different screen sizes?  \n- Is the navigation hierarchy intuitive, or do users need too many clicks to reach core features?  \n- Are error states and feedback messages clear and consistent?  \n- Could any visual design choices be causing cognitive overload or confusion?  \n- Risk: Missing a critical accessibility violation that could block users with disabilities.\n\n**3) Concrete next actions**  \n- `cat web/static/index.html` → review markup.  \n- `cat web/static/css/style.css` → review styling, breakpoints, contrast.  \n- `cat web/static/js/app.js` → review interactivity and focus management.  \n- `cat web/static/persona-editor.html` → review form usability.  \n- Create/overwrite `docs/UX_REVIEW.md` with findings.  \n- Draft a prioritized recommendation list (e.g., “Add `aria-label` to the search button”, “Increase contrast for primary CTA”, “Collapse secondary navigation on mobile”).  \n- If a specific fix is evident, write a patch snippet (e.g., CSS rule to increase contrast).\n\n**4) Proposed patch snippets**  \n```css\n/* style.css – increase contrast for primary button */\n.btn-primary {\n    background-color: #0066cc;   /* was #004499 */\n    color: #ffffff;\n}\n\n/* app.js – ensure focus is returned after modal close */\nfunction closeModal() {\n    const modal = document.getElementById('modal');\n    modal.style.display = 'none';\n    const focused = document.activeElement;\n    if (focused && focused.focus) focused.focus(); // return focus to trigger\n}\n```\n\n**CLAIM_BEAD bd-015**"
