title: Evaluate and implement service mesh (Linkerd or Istio)
description: |-
    Research and potentially implement service mesh for advanced traffic management.

    Features:
    - Automatic mTLS between services
    - Circuit breaking and retries
    - Distributed tracing
    - Traffic splitting (canary deployments)
    - Better observability

    Evaluation:
    1. Assess if complexity is justified for our use case
    2. Compare Linkerd (lighter) vs Istio (more features)
    3. Test in staging environment
    4. Measure overhead (latency, resource usage)
    5. Document pros/cons

    If proceeding:
    1. Deploy service mesh control plane
    2. Enable sidecar injection
    3. Configure mTLS policies
    4. Set up traffic rules
    5. Integrate with monitoring

    Deliverables:
    - Service mesh evaluation report
    - Implementation plan (if approved)
    - Performance benchmarks
