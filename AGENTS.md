# AgentiCorp Developer & User Guide

Welcome to AgentiCorp - the Agent Orchestration System. This guide helps you get started with developing agents, creating work items (beads), and using the system.

## Documentation

Start with the **[System Manual](MANUAL.md)** for a complete overview.

Then reference the specific guides below:

- **[User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md)** - Getting started, UI usage, project registration
- **[Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design, components, data flow
- **[Entities Reference](docs/ENTITIES_REFERENCE.md)** - All data structures (Agent, Bead, Provider, etc.)
- **[Temporal DSL Guide](docs/TEMPORAL_DSL.md)** - Workflow language for agents
- **[Worker System](docs/WORKER_SYSTEM.md)** - Agent execution model
- **[Beads Workflow](docs/BEADS_WORKFLOW.md)** - Creating and managing work items
- **[Project State Management](docs/PROJECT_STATE_MANAGEMENT.md)** - State persistence

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the System

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Access at `http://localhost:8080`

### 2. Register a Provider

Navigate to **Providers** → **Register Provider** and enter:
- Endpoint: `http://your-llm:8000`
- Model: `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-FP8`

Provider automatically checks health and transitions to `active`.

### 3. Create a Project

Via `config.yaml` or **Projects** → **Add Project**:
```yaml
id: myapp
name: My App
git_repo: https://github.com/user/repo
branch: main
beads_path: .beads
is_sticky: true
```

### 4. Create Beads

Use the `bd` command to create beads:
```bash
bd create "New Feature" --type feature --priority 4 \
  --description "Description of work"
```

All beads are stored in `.beads/issues.jsonl` and managed via the `bd` CLI tool.

### 5. Assign Agents

**Project Viewer** → **Assign Agents** and select personas.

Agents automatically work when providers are available.

## Creating Custom Agents

### Step 1: Define Persona

Create `personas/default/my-role.md`:

```markdown
# My Agent Role

## Instructions
Define what this agent does, how it thinks, and what decisions it can make.

## Capabilities
- Capability 1
- Capability 2
- Can request workflows via Temporal DSL

## Using Temporal Workflows

Request long-running operations without providers:

<temporal>
WORKFLOW: AnalyzeData
  INPUT: {"source": "database"}
  TIMEOUT: 5m
  WAIT: true
END
</temporal>

Or schedule recurring tasks:

<temporal>
SCHEDULE: DailyReport
  INTERVAL: 24h
  INPUT: {"scope": "all"}
END
</temporal>
```

See [Temporal DSL Guide](docs/TEMPORAL_DSL.md) for workflow syntax.

### Step 2: Assign to Project

Via UI: **Projects** → Select Project → **Assign Agent**  
Or via API: `POST /api/v1/agents`

### Step 3: Monitor

**Project Viewer** shows agent status and current work.

## Working with Beads - Two Contexts

AgentiCorp uses the **Beads** CLI tool for issue tracking in two contexts:

### 1. AgentiCorp's Own Beads (Meta-Work)

Located in **this repository** at `.beads/issues.jsonl`, these track work ON AgentiCorp itself:

- Features/bugs in AgentiCorp
- Documentation updates  
- Infrastructure work
- CI/CD improvements

**Managed via:**
- `bd` CLI tool exclusively
- JSONL format (not YAML files)
- Git-native sync with `bd sync`

### 2. Project Beads (Application Work)

When you register a project with AgentiCorp, it:

1. **Clones the project's git repository** into a work area
2. **Loads beads** from that project's `.beads/issues.jsonl` file
3. **Assigns agents** to work on those beads
4. **Commits changes** back to the project's repository

**Project registration** requires:
```yaml
id: myapp
name: My Application
git_repo: https://github.com/user/myapp
branch: main
beads_path: .beads
```

**Each project's beads live in its own repo**, not in AgentiCorp's repo.

### Git Repository Management

AgentiCorp runs in containers and proxies all git operations for managed projects:

- **Clone**: Fetches project repos into isolated work areas (`/app/src/<project-id>`)
- **Pull**: Keeps projects up-to-date with remote changes
- **Commit**: Saves agent work with descriptive commit messages
- **Push**: Publishes completed work back to origin
- **SSH/Credentials**: Managed securely per project

### Summary

- **AgentiCorp beads**: Live in `.beads/issues.jsonl` in THIS repo (AgentiCorp itself)
- **Project beads**: Live in `.beads/issues.jsonl` in EACH project's own repo
- **Beads CLI**: All bead operations use the `bd` command
- **Git proxying**: AgentiCorp manages git operations for all registered projects
- **Isolation**: Each project gets its own work area and git workspace

## Creating Agent Work Items (Beads)

Agent beads are work items that AI agents pick up and execute. Use the `bd` CLI to manage them:

```bash
# Create a new bead
bd create "Implement Feature X" \
  --type feature \
  --priority 2 \
  --description "Detailed description of the work"

# Update status
bd update bd-001 --status in_progress

# Add dependencies
bd update bd-002 --deps "blocked-by:bd-001"

# Close when done
bd update bd-001 --status closed

# View all beads
bd list

# View open beads
bd list open
```

**Priority Levels**:
- P0 (0): Critical, blocking work
- P1 (1): High priority
- P2 (2): Normal priority (default)
- P3 (3): Low priority, nice-to-have

**Prefer using the AgentiCorp API or Web UI to create/update beads for agents.**

### Dependencies

Beads support dependency relationships:

```bash
# Create a dependency (bd-002 is blocked by bd-001)
bd update bd-002 --deps "blocked-by:bd-001"

# Create a blocks relationship
bd update bd-001 --deps "blocks:bd-002"

# Parent-child relationships
bd create "Sub-task" --parent bd-050
```

Circular dependencies are automatically detected by the `bd` CLI.

## Using Temporal DSL in Agents

The Temporal DSL lets agents request workflows without external providers:

### WORKFLOW - Execute Workflow

```markdown
<temporal>
WORKFLOW: ProcessData
  INPUT: {"dataset": "large"}
  TIMEOUT: 10m
  WAIT: true
  RETRY: 3
END
</temporal>
```

### SCHEDULE - Recurring Task

```markdown
<temporal>
SCHEDULE: HealthMonitoring
  INTERVAL: 1h
  INPUT: {"check_type": "comprehensive"}
END
</temporal>
```

### QUERY - Get Workflow State

```markdown
<temporal>
QUERY: wf-123
  TYPE: get_progress
END
</temporal>
```

### SIGNAL - Send Message to Workflow

```markdown
<temporal>
SIGNAL: approval-wf-456
  NAME: approve
  DATA: {"amount": 50000}
END
</temporal>
```

See [TEMPORAL_DSL.md](docs/TEMPORAL_DSL.md) for complete reference.

## Repository Rules

- All documentation goes in `docs/`.
- All internal AI planning files (generated `.md` files) go in `plans/`.
- All intermediate object files go in `obj/` and are never committed to git.
- All binaries go in `bin/` and are never committed to git.

## Building & Testing

```bash
# Build Docker images
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make fmt

# Clean reset (wipes database)
make distclean
```

## Troubleshooting

### Providers show "pending"
- Check provider endpoint is accessible
- Verify `/v1/models` returns models
- Check Docker network configuration (if containerized)

### Beads not loading
- Verify YAML syntax
- Check beads path exists in git
- Verify `project_id` matches

### Agents paused
- Check provider status is `active`
- Verify agent assigned to project
- Check for errors in logs

### Temporal issues
- Verify Temporal running: `docker ps | grep temporal`
- Check logs: `docker logs temporal`
- Restart: `docker compose restart temporal`

## Common Use Cases

### Run Periodic Tasks
Use `SCHEDULE` in Temporal DSL for recurring work without external providers.

### Approval Workflows
Create decision beads that route to CEO/manager agents for approval.

### Data Analysis
Use provider agents for heavy computation, Temporal workflows for orchestration.

### Multi-Step Workflows
Chain beads with dependencies, use signals to coordinate between agents.

## Key Entities

| Entity | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Agent** | AI actor with role and instructions |
| **Bead** | Unit of work with status and dependencies |
| **Provider** | External LLM service |
| **Project** | Container for related work |
| **Persona** | Behavioral instructions for agents |
| **Workflow** | Temporal long-running process |
| **DSL** | Temporal workflow syntax for agents |

- **Questions**: Check documentation and architecture guides
- **Contributions**: Follow repository rules above

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
